\newsection{134}
     
The special properties of Lebesgue measure will take up a substantial
proportion of this treatise.   In this section I present a miscellany of
relatively easy basic results.    In
134A-134F, %134A 134B 134D 134E 134F
$r$ will be a fixed
integer greater than or equal to $1$, $\mu$ will be Lebesgue measure on
$\BbbR^r$ and $\mu^*$ will be Lebesgue outer measure\cmmnt{ (see
132C)};  when I say that a set or a function is `measurable', then it is
to be understood that (unless otherwise stated) this means `measurable
with respect to the $\sigma$-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets', while
`negligible' means `negligible for Lebesgue measure'.   Most of the
results will be expressed in terms adapted to the
multi-dimensional case;  but if you are primarily interested in the
real line, you will miss none of the ideas if you read the
whole section as if $r=1$.
     
\leader{134A}{Proposition} Both Lebesgue outer measure and Lebesgue
measure are translation-invariant;  that is, setting
$A+x=\{a+x:a\in A\}$ for $A\subseteq\BbbR^r$, $x\in\BbbR^r$, we have
     
(a) $\mu^*(A+x)=\mu^* A$ for every $A\subseteq\BbbR^r$, $x\in\BbbR^r$;
     
(b) whenever $E\subseteq\BbbR^r$ is measurable and $x\in\BbbR^r$, then
$E+x$ is measurable, with $\mu(E+x)=\mu E$.
     
\proof{ The point is that if $I\subseteq\BbbR^r$ is a
half-open interval, as defined in 114Aa/115Ab, then so is $I+x$, and
$\lambda(I+x)=\lambda I$ for
every $x\in\BbbR^r$, where $\lambda$ is defined as in 114Ab/115Ac;
this is immediate from the definition, since
$\coint{a,b}+x=\coint{a+x,b+x}$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (a)} If $A\subseteq\BbbR^r$ and $x\in\BbbR^r$ and $\epsilon>0$,
we
can find a sequence $\langle I_j\rangle_{j\in\Bbb N}$ of half-open
intervals such that $A\subseteq\bigcup_{j\in\Bbb N}I_j$ and
$\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\lambda I_j\le\mu^* A+\epsilon$.   Now
$A+x\subseteq\bigcup_{j\in\Bbb N}(I_j+x)$ so
     
     
\Centerline{$\mu^*(A+x)\le\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\lambda
(I_j+x)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\lambda I_j\le\mu^* A+\epsilon$.}
     
\noindent   As
$\epsilon$ is arbitrary, $\mu^* (A+x)\le\mu^* A$.   Similarly
     
\Centerline{$\mu^*A=\mu^*((A+x)+(-x))\le\mu^*(A+x)$,}
     
\noindent so $\mu^*(A+x)=\mu^* A$, as claimed.
     
\wheader{134A}{6}{2}{2}{12pt}
     
{\bf (b)} Now suppose that $E\subseteq\BbbR^r$ is measurable and
$x\in\BbbR^r$, and that $A\subseteq\BbbR^r$.   Then, using (a)
repeatedly,
     
$$\eqalign{\mu^*(A\cap(E+x))+\mu^*(A\setminus(E+x))
&=\mu^*(((A-x)\cap E)+x)+\mu^*(((A-x)\setminus E)+x)\cr
&=\mu^*((A-x)\cap E)+\mu^*((A-x)\setminus E)\cr
&=\mu^*(A-x)
=\mu^* A,\cr}$$
     
\noindent writing $A-x$ for $A+(-x)=\{a-x:a\in A\}$.   As $A$ is
arbitrary, $E+x$ is measurable.   Now
     
\Centerline{$\mu(E+x)=\mu^*(E+x)=\mu^* E=\mu
E$.}
}%end of proof of 134A
     
     
     
\leader{134B}{Theorem} Not every subset of $\BbbR^r$ is Lebesgue
measurable.
     
\proof{ Set $\tbf{0}=(0,\ldots,0)$, $\tbf{1}=(1,\ldots,1)\in\BbbR^r$.
On
     
\Centerline{$\coint{\tbf{0},\tbf{1}}
=\{(\xi_1,\ldots,\xi_r):\xi_i\in\coint{0,1}$ for every $i\le r\}$,}
     
\noindent consider the relation $\sim$,
defined by saying that $x\sim y$ iff $y-x\in\BbbQ^r$.   It is easy to
see
that this is an equivalence relation, so divides
$\coint{\tbf{0},\tbf{1}}$ into
equivalence classes.
Choose one point from each of these equivalence classes, and let $A$ be
the set of points obtained in this way.
Then $\mu^* A\le\mu^*\coint{\tbf{0},\tbf{1}}=1$.
     
Consider $A+\BbbQ^r=\{a+q:a\in A,\,q\in\BbbQ^r\}
=\bigcup_{q\in\BbbQ^r}A+q$.   This is equal to $\BbbR^r$.   \Prf\ If
$x\in\BbbR^r$,
there is
an $e\in\BbbZ^r$ such that $x-e\in\coint{\tbf{0},\tbf{1}}$;  there is
an $a\in A$
such that $a\sim x-e$, that is, $x-e-a\in\BbbQ^r$;  now
$x=a+(e+x-e-a)\in A+\BbbQ^r$.\ \Qed\   Next, $\BbbQ^r$ is countable
(111F(b-iv)), so we have
     
\Centerline{$\infty=\mu \BbbR^r\le\sum_{q\in\BbbQ^r}\mu^*(A+q)$,}
     
\noindent and there must be some $q\in\BbbQ^r$ such that
$\mu^*(A+q)>0$;
but as $\mu^*$ is translation-invariant (134A), $\mu^* A>0$.
     
Take $n\in\Bbb N$ such that $n>2^r/\mu^* A$, and distinct
$q_1,\ldots,q_n\in\coint{\tbf{0},\tbf{1}}\cap\BbbQ^r$.   If $a$, $b\in
A$ and $1\le
i<j\le n$, then $a+q_i\ne b+q_j$;  for if $a=b$ then $q_i\ne q_j$, while
if $a\ne b$ then $a\not\sim b$ so $b-a\ne q_i-q_j$.   Thus
$A+q_1,\ldots,A+q_n$ are disjoint.   On the other hand, all are subsets
of $\coint{\tbf{0},\tbf{2}}$.   So we have
     
\Centerline{$\sum_{i=1}^n\mu^*(A+q_i)
=n\mu^* A>2^r=\mu\coint{\tbf{0},\tbf{2}}\ge\mu^*(\bigcup_{1\le i\le
n}(A+q_i))$.}
     
\noindent It follows that not all the $A+q_i$ can be measurable;  as
Lebesgue measure is translation-invariant, we see that $A$ itself is not
measurable.   In any case we have found a non-measurable set.
}%end of proof of 134B
     
     
\cmmnt{
\leader{*134C}{Remark} 134B is known as `Vitali's construction'.

Observe that at the beginning of the proof I
asked you to {\it choose} one member of each of the equivalence classes
for $\sim$.   This is of course an appeal to the Axiom of Choice.   So
far I have made rather few appeals to the axiom of choice.   One was in
(a-iv) of the proof of 114D/115D;  an earlier one was in 112Db;
yet another in 121A.  See also 1A1F.   In all of
these, only `countable choice' was involved;  that is, I
needed to choose simultaneously one member of each of a named sequence
of sets.   Because there are surely uncountably many equivalence classes
for $\sim$, the form of choice needed for the example above is
essentially stronger than that needed for the positive results so far.
It is in fact the case that very large parts of measure theory can be
developed without appealing to the full strength of the axiom of
choice.
     
The significance of this is that it suggests the possibility that there
might be a consistent mathematical system in which enough of the axiom
of choice is valid to make measure theory possible, without having
enough to construct a non-Lebesgue-measurable set.   Such a system has
indeed been worked out by R.M.Solovay ({\smc Solovay 70}).   (In a
formal sense there is room for a residual doubt concerning its
consistency.   In my view this is of no importance.)   In Volume 5
I will return to the question of what Lebesgue measure looks like with a
weak axiom of choice, or none at all.   For
the moment, I have to say that 
nearly all measure theory continues to proceed in directions at least
consistent with the full axiom of choice, so that non-measurable sets
are constantly present, at least potentially;  and that will be my
normal position in this treatise.   But I mention the point at this
early stage because I believe that it could happen at any time that the
focus of interest might switch to systems in which the axiom of choice
is false;  and in this case measure theory without non-measurable sets
might become important to many pure mathematicians, and even to applied
mathematicians, who have no reason, other than the convenience of being
able to quote results from books like this one, for loyalty to the axiom
of choice.
     
I ought to remark that while we need a fairly strong form of the axiom
of choice to construct a non-Lebesgue-measurable set, a non-Borel set
can be constructed in much weaker set theories.   One possible
construction is outlined in \S423 in Volume 4.
     
Of course there is a non-Lebesgue-measurable subset of $\Bbb R$ iff
there is a non-Lebesgue-measurable function from $\Bbb R$ to $\Bbb R$;
for if every set is measurable, then the definition 121C makes it plain
that every real-valued function on any subset of $\Bbb R$ is measurable;
while if $A\subseteq\Bbb R$ is not measurable, then
$\chi A:\Bbb R\to\Bbb R$ is not measurable.
}%end of comment
     
\leader{*134D}{}\cmmnt{ In fact there are much stronger results
than 134B
concerning the existence of non-measurable sets (provided, of course,
that we allow ourselves to use the axiom of choice).   Here I give one
which can be reached by a slight refinement of the methods of 134B.
     
\medskip
     
\noindent}{\bf Proposition} There is a set $C\subseteq\BbbR^r$ such that
$F\cap C$ is not measurable for any measurable set $F$ of
non-zero measure;  so that both $C$ and its complement have full outer
measure in $\BbbR^r$.
     
\proof{{\bf (a)} Start from a set
$A\subseteq\coint{\tbf{0},\tbf{1}}\subseteq\BbbR^r$ such that
$\langle A+q\rangle_{q\in\BbbQ^r}$ is a partition of $\BbbR^r$, as
constructed in the proof of 134B.   As in 134B, the outer measure
$\mu^*A$ of $A$ must be greater than $0$.   The argument there shows in
fact that $\mu F=0$ for every measurable set $F\subseteq A$.   \Prf\
For every $n$ we can find distinct
$q_1,\ldots,q_n\in\coint{\tbf{0},\tbf{1}}\cap\BbbQ^r$, and now
     
\Centerline{$n\mu F=\mu(\bigcup_{1\le i\le
n}F+q_i)\le\mu\coint{\tbf{0},\tbf{2}}=2^r$,}
     
\noindent so that $\mu F\le 2^r/n$;  as $n$ is arbitrary, $\mu F=0$.
\Qed
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (b)} Now let $E\subseteq\coint{\tbf{0},\tbf{1}}$ be a measurable
envelope of $A$ (132Ef).   Then $E+q$ is a
measurable envelope of $A+q$ for any $q$.   \Prf\ I hope that this will
very soon be `an obvious consequence of the translation-invariance of
Lebesgue measure'.   In detail:  $A+q\subseteq E+q$, $E+q$ is measurable
and, for any measurable $F$,
     
$$\eqalign{\mu(F\cap(E+q))
&=\mu(((F-q)\cap E)+q)
=\mu((F-q)\cap E)\cr
&=\mu^*((F-q)\cap A)
=\mu^*(((F-q)\cap A)+q)
=\mu^*(F\cap(A+q)),\cr}$$
     
\noindent using 134A repeatedly.\ \Qed\  Also $E$ is a measurable
envelope of $A'=E\setminus A$.
\Prf\ Of course $E$ is a measurable set including $A'$.   If
$F\subseteq E\setminus A'$ is measurable then $F\subseteq A$, so
$\mu F=0$, by (a);  now 132Ea tells us that $E$ is a measurable envelope
of $A'$.\ \Qed\   It follows that $E+q$ is a
measurable envelope of $A'+q$ for every $q$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (c)} Let $\sequencen{q_n}$ be a sequence running over $\BbbQ^r$.
Then
     
\Centerline{$\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}E+q_n
\supseteq\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}A+q_n=\BbbR^r$.}
     
\noindent Write $E_n$ for $E+q_n\setminus\bigcup_{i<n}E+q_i$ for
$n\in\Bbb N$, so that $\sequencen{E_n}$ is disjoint and
$\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}E_n=\BbbR^r$.
     
Now set
     
\Centerline{$C=\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}E_n\cap(A+q_n)$.}
     
\noindent This is a set with the required properties.
     
\Prf\ {\bf (i)} Let $F\subseteq\BbbR^r$ be any non-negligible measurable
set.   Then there must be some $n\in\Bbb N$ such that
$\mu(F\cap E_n)>0$.   But this means that
     
\Centerline{$\mu^*(F\cap E_n\cap C)\ge\mu^*(F\cap E_n\cap(A+q_n))
=\mu(F\cap E_n\cap(E+q_n))=\mu(F\cap E_n)$,}
     
$$\eqalign{\mu^*(F\cap E_n\setminus C)
&\ge\mu^*(F\cap E_n\cap((E+q_n)\setminus(A+q_n)))\cr
&=\mu(F\cap E_n\cap(E+q_n))
=\mu(F\cap E_n).\cr}$$
     
\noindent Since
     
\Centerline{$\mu(F\cap E_n)\le\mu(E+q_n)=\mu E\le 1$,}
     
\noindent
$\mu^*(F\cap E_n\cap C)+\mu^*(F\cap E_n\setminus C)>\mu(F\cap E_n)$, and
$F\cap C$ cannot be measurable.
     
\medskip
     
\quad{\bf (ii)} In particular, no measurable subset of
$\BbbR^r\setminus C$ can have non-zero measure, and $C$ has full outer
measure;  similarly, $C$ has no measurable subset of non-zero measure,
and $\BbbR^r\setminus C$ has full outer measure.\ \Qed
}%end of proof of 134D
     
\cmmnt{\medskip
     
\noindent{\bf Remark} In fact it is the case that for any sequence
$\sequencen{D_n}$ of subsets of $\BbbR^r$ there is a set
$C\subseteq\BbbR^r$ such that
     
\Centerline{$\mu^*(E\cap D_n\cap C)=\mu^*(E\cap D_n\setminus C)
=\mu^*(E\cap D_n)$}

$n\in\Bbb N$.   But for the
proof of this result we must wait for Volume 5.

\leader{134E}{Borel sets and Lebesgue measure on $\BbbR^r$}
Recall from 111G
that the family $\Cal B$ of Borel sets in $\BbbR^r$ is the
$\sigma$-algebra generated by the family of open sets.   In 114G/115G I
showed that every Borel set in $\BbbR^r$ is Lebesgue measurable.   It
is time we returned to the topic and looked more closely at the very
intimate connexion between Borel and measurable sets.
     
Recall that a set $A\subseteq\BbbR^r$ is {\bf bounded} if
there is an $M$ such that $A\subseteq B(\tbf{0},M)=\{x:\|x\|\le M\}$;
equivalently, if $\sup_{x\in A}|\xi_j|<\infty$ for every $j\le r$
(writing $x=(\xi_1,\ldots,\xi_r)$, as in \S115).
}%end of comment
     
\leader{134F}{Proposition} (a) If $A\subseteq\BbbR^r$ is any set, then
     
\Centerline{$\mu^*A
=\inf\{\mu G:G\text{ is open},\,G\supseteq A\}
=\min\{\mu H:H\text{ is Borel},\,H\supseteq A\}$.}
     
(b)   If $E\subseteq\BbbR^r$ is measurable, then
     
\Centerline{$\mu E=\sup\{\mu F:F
\text{ is closed and bounded},\,F\subseteq E\}$,}
     
\noindent and there are Borel sets $H_1$, $H_2$ such that 
$H_1\subseteq E\subseteq H_2$ and
     
\Centerline{$\mu(H_2\setminus H_1)=\mu(H_2\setminus
E)=\mu(E\setminus H_1)=0$.}
     
(c) If $A\subseteq\BbbR^r$ is any set, then $A$ has a measurable
envelope which is a Borel set.
     
(d) If $f$ is a Lebesgue measurable real-valued function defined on a
subset of $\BbbR^r$, then there is a conegligible Borel set
$H\subseteq\BbbR^r$ such that $f\restr H$ is Borel measurable.
     
\proof{{\bf (a)(i)} First note that if $I\subseteq\BbbR^r$ is a
half-open interval, and $\epsilon>0$, then either $I=\emptyset$ is
already open, or $I$ is expressible as $\coint{a,b}$ where
$a=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_r)$, $b=(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_r)$ and
$\alpha_i<\beta_i$ for every $i$.   In the latter case,
$G=\ooint{a-\epsilon(b-a),b}$ is an open set including $I$, and
     
\Centerline{$\mu G=\prod_{i=1}^r(1+\epsilon)(\beta_i-\alpha_i)
=(1+\epsilon)^r\mu I$,}
     
\noindent by the formula in 114G/115G.
     
\medskip
     
\quad{\bf (ii)} Now, given $\epsilon>0$, there is a sequence
$\sequencen{I_n}$ of half-open intervals, covering $A$, such that
$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\mu I_n\le\mu^*A+\epsilon$.   For each $n$, let
$G_n\supseteq I_n$ be an open set of measure at most
$(1+\epsilon)^r\mu I_n$.   Then $G=\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}G_n$ is open
(1A2Bd), and $A\subseteq G$;  also
     
\Centerline{$\mu G\le\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\mu G_n
\le(1+\epsilon)^r\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\mu I_n
\le(1+\epsilon)^r(\mu^*A+\epsilon)$.}
     
\noindent As $\epsilon$ is arbitrary,
$\mu^*A\ge\inf\{\mu G:G$ is open, $G\supseteq A\}$.
     
\medskip
     
\quad{\bf (iii)} Next, using (ii), we can choose for each $n\in\Bbb N$
an open set $G_n\supseteq A$ such that $\mu G_n\le\mu^*A+2^{-n}$.   Set
$H_0=\bigcap_{n\in\Bbb N}G_n$;  then $H_0$ is a Borel set,
$A\subseteq H_0$, and
     
\Centerline{$\mu H_0\le\inf_{n\in\Bbb N}\mu G_n\le\mu^*A$.}
     
\medskip
     
\quad{\bf (iv)} On the other hand, we surely have
$\mu^*A\le\mu^*H=\mu H$ for every Borel set $H\supseteq A$.   So we must
have
     
\Centerline{$\mu^*A\le\inf\{\mu G:G\text{ is open},\,G\supseteq A\}$,}
     
\noindent and
     
\Centerline{$\mu^*A=\mu H_0
=\min\{\mu H:H\text{ is Borel},\,H\supseteq A\}$.}
     
\medskip
     
     
{\bf (b)(i)} For each $n\in\Bbb N$, set $E_n=E\cap B(\tbf{0},n)$.
Let $G_n\supseteq E_n$ be an open set of measure at most
$\mu E_n+2^{-n}$;  then (because $\mu B(\tbf{0},n)<\infty$)
$\mu(G_n\setminus E_n)\le 2^{-n}$.
Now, for each $n$, set $G'_n=\bigcup_{m\ge n}G_m$;  then
$G'_n$ is open, $E=\bigcup_{m\ge n}E_m\subseteq G'_n$, and
     
\Centerline{$\mu(G'_n\setminus E)\le\sum_{m=n}^{\infty}\mu(G_m\setminus
E)\le\sum_{m=n}^{\infty}\mu(G_m\setminus E_m)
\le\sum_{m=n}^{\infty}2^{-m}=2^{-n+1}$.}
     
\noindent Setting $H_2=\bigcap_{n\in\Bbb N}G_n$, we see that $H_2$ is a
Borel set including $E$ and that $\mu(H_2\setminus E)=0$.
     
\medskip
     
\quad{\bf (ii)} Repeating the argument of (i) with $\BbbR^r\setminus E$
in place of $E$, we obtain
a Borel set $\tilde H_2\supseteq\BbbR^r\setminus E$ such that
$\mu(\tilde H_2\setminus(\BbbR^r\setminus E))=0$;  now
$H_1=\BbbR^r\setminus \tilde H_2$ is a Borel set included in $E$ and
     
\Centerline{$\mu(E\setminus H_1)
=\mu(\tilde H_2\setminus(\BbbR^r\setminus E))=0$.}
     
\noindent Of course we now also have
     
\Centerline{$\mu(H_2\setminus H_1)=\mu(H_2\setminus E)+\mu(E\setminus
H_1)=0$.}
     
\medskip
     
\quad{\bf (iii)} Again using the idea of (i), there is for each
$n\in\Bbb N$
an open set $\tilde G_n\supseteq B(\tbf{0},n)\setminus E$ such that
     
\Centerline{$\mu(\tilde G_n\cap E_n)\le\mu(\tilde
G_n\setminus(B(\tbf{0},n)\setminus E))\le 2^{-n}$.}
     
\noindent Set
     
\Centerline{$F_n=B(\tbf{0},n)\setminus\tilde G_n
=B(\tbf{0},n)\cap(\BbbR^r\setminus\tilde G_n)$;}
     
\noindent  then $F_n$ is
closed (1A2Fd) and bounded and $F_n\subseteq E_n\subseteq E$.
Also
     
\Centerline{$\mu E_n=\mu F_n+\mu(E_n\setminus F_n)
=\mu F_n+\mu(\tilde G_n\cap E_n)
\le\mu F_n+2^{-n}$.}
     
\noindent So
     
\Centerline{$\mu E=\lim_{n\to\infty}\mu E_n
\le\sup_{n\in\Bbb N}\mu F_n\le
\sup\{\mu F:F\text{ is closed and bounded},\,F\subseteq E\}$,}
     
\noindent and
     
\Centerline{$\mu E
=\sup\{\mu F:F\text{ is closed and bounded},\,F\subseteq E\}$.}
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (c)} Let $E$ be any measurable envelope of $A$ (132Ef), and
$H\supseteq E$ a Borel set such that $\mu(H\setminus E)=0$;  then
$\mu^*(F\cap A)=\mu(F\cap E)=\mu(F\cap H)$ for every measurable set $F$,
so $H$ is a measurable envelope of $A$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (d)} Set $D=\dom f$ and write $\Cal B$ for the $\sigma$-algebra of
Borel sets.   For each rational number $q$, let $E_q$ be a measurable
set such that $\{x:f(x)\le q\}=E_q\cap D$.   Let $H_q$, $H_q'\in\Cal B$
be such that $H_q\subseteq E_q\subseteq H'_q$ and
$\mu(H'_q\setminus H_q)=0$.   Let $H$ be the conegligible Borel set
$\BbbR^r\setminus\bigcup(H'_q\setminus H_q)$.   Then
     
\Centerline{$\{x:(f\restr H)(x)\le q\}=H\cap E_q\cap D=H_q\cap D\cap H$}
     
\noindent belongs to the subspace $\sigma$-algebra $\Cal B(D)$ for every
$q\in\Bbb Q$.   For irrational $a\in\Bbb R$, set
$H_a=\bigcap_{q\in\Bbb Q,q\ge a}H_q$;  then $H_a\in\Cal B$, and
     
\Centerline{$\{x:(f\restr H)(x)\le a\}=H_a\cap\dom(f\restr H)$.}
     
\noindent Thus $f\restr H$ is Borel measurable.

intervals each of length $3^{-n-1}$;  take $C_{n+1}$ to be the union of

Of these, the second exists as a Lebesgue integral, but the first does
not, because $\int_0^{\infty}|\bover{\sin x}{x}|dx=\infty$.   The power

$h$ must be Riemann integrable, with integrals equal to
$\Rint_a^bf$.   By 134Kb, they are both Lebesgue integrable, with the

\endnotes{
\Notesheader{134} Lebesgue measure enjoys an enormous variety of special
properties, corresponding to the richness of the real line, with its
algebraic and topological and order structures.   Here I have only been
able to hint at what is possible.
     
There are many methods of constructing non-measurable sets, all
significant;  the one I give in 134B is perhaps the most accessible, and
shows that translation-invariance is (subject to the axiom of choice) an
insuperable barrier to measuring every subset of $\Bbb R$.
     
In 134F I list some of the basic relationships between the measure and
the topology of Euclidean space.   Others are in 134Yc, 134Yd and 134Yg;
see also 134Xd.    A systematic analysis of these will take up a large
part of Volume 4.
     
The Cantor set and function (134G-134I) form one of the basic examples
in the theory.  Here I present them just as an interesting design and as
a counter-example to a natural conjecture.   But they will reappear in
three different chapters of Volume 2 as illustrations of three quite
different phenomena.
     
The relationship between the Lebesgue and Riemann integrals goes a good
deal deeper than I wish to explore just at present;  the fact that the
Lebesgue integral extends the Riemann integral (134Kb) is only a small
part of the story, and I should be sorry if you were left with the
impression that the Lebesgue integral therefore renders the Riemann
integral obsolete.   Without going into the details here, I hope that
134F and 134Yg make it plain that the Lebesgue integral is in some sense
the canonical extension of the Riemann integral.   (This, at least, I
shall return to in Chapter 43.)   Another way of
looking at this is 134Yf;  the Lebesgue integral is the basic
translation-invariant integral on $\BbbR^r$.
