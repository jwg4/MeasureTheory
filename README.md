This is a copy of Professor David H. Fremlin's great series of Measure Theory. The source files are from https://www1.essex.ac.uk/maths/people/fremlin/mt.htm
To compile, run

  tex main.tex

Remember, not latex, but tex.
Currently, the ps files (graphs) cannot be inserted to the dvi output, which is an issue.
