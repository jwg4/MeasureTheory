Perhaps the most glaring problem associated with the theory of
measure-preserving homomorphisms and automorphisms is the fact that we
have no generally effective method of determining when two homomorphisms
are the same, in the sense that two structures $(\frak A,\bar\mu,\pi)$
and $(\frak B,\bar\nu,\phi)$ are isomorphic, where $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$
and $(\frak B,\bar\nu)$ are measure algebras and $\pi:\frak A\to\frak
A$, $\phi:\frak B\to\frak B$ are Boolean homomorphisms.   Of course the
first part of the problem is to decide whether $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$ and
$(\frak B,\bar\nu)$ are isomorphic;  but this is solved (at least for
localizable algebras) by Maharam's theorem\cmmnt{ (see 332J)}.   The difficulty
lies in the homomorphisms.   Even when we know that $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$
and $(\frak B,\bar\nu)$ are both isomorphic to the Lebesgue measure
algebra, the extraordinary variety of constructions of
homomorphisms -- corresponding in part to the variety of
measure spaces with such measure
algebras, each with its own natural \imp\ functions -- means that the
question of which are isomorphic to each other is continually being
raised.   In this section I give the most elementary ideas associated
with the concept of `entropy', up to the Kolmogorov-Sina\v\i\ theorem
(385P).   This is an invariant which can be attached to any
measure-preserving homomorphism on a probability algebra, and therefore
provides a useful method for distinguishing non-isomorphic
homomorphisms.
     
The main work of the section deals with homomorphisms on measure
algebras, but as many of the most important ones arise from \imp\
functions on measure spaces.   I comment on the extra problems arising in the isomorphism problem for such functions (385T-385V).   I should
remark that some of the lemmas will be repeated in stronger forms in the
next section.
     
\leader{385A}{Notation} %(2002) 3{}84A
Throughout this section, I will use the letter
$q$ to denote the function from $\coint{0,\infty}$ to $\Bbb R$
defined by saying that $q(t)=-t\ln t=t\ln\bover1t$ if $t>0$, $q(0)=0$.
     
\def\Caption{The function $q$}
\picture{mt385a}{100pt}
     
\noindent We shall need the following straightforward facts concerning
$q$.
     
\spheader 385Aa $q$ is continuous on $\coint{0,\infty}$ and
differentiable on $\ooint{0,\infty}$;  $q'(t)=-1-\ln t$ and
$q''(t)=-\bover1t$ for $t>0$.    \prooflet{Because $q''$ is negative,}
$q$ is concave\cmmnt{, that is, $-q$ is convex}.   $q$ has a unique
maximum at $(\bover1e,\bover1e)$.
     
\spheader 385Ab \prooflet{If $s\ge 0$ and $t>0$ then $q'(s+t)\le q'(t)$;
consequently}
     
\Centerline{$q(s+t)\cmmnt{\mskip5mu
=q(s)+\biggerint_0^tq'(s+\tau)d\tau}\le q(s)+q(t)$}
     
\noindent for $s$, $t\ge 0$.    \cmmnt{It follows that
$q(\sum_{i=0}^ns_i)\le\sum_{i=0}^nq(s_i)$ for all $s_0,\ldots,s_n\ge 0$
and (because $q$ is continuous)}
$q(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}s_i)\le\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}q(s_i)$ for every
non-negative summable series $\sequence{i}{s_i}$.
     
\spheader 385Ac If $s$, $t\ge 0$ then $q(st)=sq(t)+tq(s)$;  more
generally, if $n\ge 1$ and $s_i\ge 0$ for $i\le n$ then
     
\Centerline{$q(\prod_{i=0}^ns_i)=\sum_{j=0}^nq(s_j)\prod_{i\ne j}s_i$.}
     
\spheader 385Ad The function $t\mapsto q(t)+q(1-t)$ has a unique maximum
at $(\bover12,\ln 2)$.
\prooflet{($\bover{d}{dt}(q(t)+q(1-t))=\ln\bover{1-t}{t}$.)}
\cmmnt{It
follows that for every $\epsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that
$|t-\bover12|\le\epsilon$ whenever $q(t)+q(1-t)\ge\ln 2-\delta$.}
     
\spheader 385Ae If $0\le t\le\bover12$, then $q(1-t)\le q(t)$.
\prooflet{\Prf\ Set $f(t)=q(t)-q(1-t)$.   Then

\noindent for $0<t\le\bover12$, while $f(0)=f(\bover12)=0$, so
$f(t)\ge 0$ for $0\le t\le\bover12$.\ \Qed}
     
\spheader 385Af(i) If $\frak A$ is a Dedekind $\sigma$-complete Boolean
algebra, I will write $\bar q$ for the function from $L^0(\frak A)^+$
to $L^0(\frak A)$ defined from $q$\cmmnt{ (364H)}.   Note that
\cmmnt{because $0\le q(t)\le 1$ for $t\in [0,1]$,}
$0\le\bar q(u)\le\chi 1$ if $0\le u\le\chi 1$.
     
\quad(ii)\cmmnt{ By (b),}
$\bar q(u+v)\le\bar q(u)+\bar q(v)$ for all $u$, $v\ge 0$ in
$L^0(\frak A)$.   \prooflet{(Represent $\frak A$ as the measure algebra
of a measure space, so that $\bar q(f^{\ssbullet})=(qf)^{\ssbullet}$, as
in 364Ib.)}
     
\quad(iii) Similarly, if $u$, $v\in L^0(\frak A)^+$, then
$\bar q(u\times v)=u\times\bar q(v)+v\times\bar q(u)$.
     
\leader{385B}{Lemma} %(2002) 3{}84B
Let $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$ be a probability algebra,
$\frak B$ a closed subalgebra of $\frak A$, and
$P:L^1(\frak A,\bar\mu)\to L^1(\frak A,\bar\mu)$ the corresponding
conditional expectation operator\cmmnt{ (365R)}.   Then
$\int\bar q(u)\le q(\int u)$ and $P(\bar q(u))\le\bar q(Pu)$ for every
$u\in L^{\infty}(\frak A)^+$.
     
\proof{ Apply the remarks in 365Rb to $-q$.
($\bar q(u)\in L^{\infty}\subseteq L^1$ for every $u\in(L^{\infty})^+$
because $q$ is
bounded on every bounded interval in $\coint{0,\infty}$.)

\leader{385C}{Definition} %(2002) 3{}84C
Let $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$ be a probability algebra.   If $A$ is a
partition of unity in $\frak A$, its {\bf entropy} is
$H(A)=\sum_{a\in A}q(\bar\mu a)$\cmmnt{, where $q$ is the function
defined in 385A}.
     
\cmmnt{\medskip
     
\noindent{\bf Remarks (a)} In the definition of `partition of unity'
(311Gc) I allowed $0$ to belong to the family.   In the present context
this is a mild irritant, and when convenient I shall remove $0$ from the
partitions of unity considered here (as in 385F below).   But
because $q(0)=0$, it makes no
difference;   $H(A)=H(A\setminus\{0\})$ whenever $A$ is a partition of
unity.   So if you wish you can read `partition of unity' in this
section to mean `partition of unity not containing $0$', if you are
willing to make an occasional amendment in a formula.   In important
cases, in fact, $A$ is of the form $\{a_i:i\in I\}$ or $\{a_i:i\in
I\}\setminus\{0\}$, where $\langle
a_i\rangle_{i\in I}$ is an indexed partition of unity, with $a_i\Bcap
a_j=0$ for $i\ne j$, but no restriction in the number of $i$ with
$a_i=0$;  in this case, we still have $H(A)=\sum_{i\in I}q(\bar\mu
a_i)$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (b)} Many authors prefer to use $\log_2$ in place of $\ln$.   This
makes sense in terms of one of the intuitive approaches to entropy as
the `information' associated with a partition.   See {\smc Petersen
83}, \S5.1.

If $\frak A$ is a Boolean algebra and $A$,
$B\subseteq\frak A$ are partitions of unity, I write $A\vee B$ for the

\leader{385G}{Lemma} %(2002) 3{}84G
Let $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$ be a probability algebra
and $\frak B$ a closed subalgebra.   Let $A\subseteq\frak A$ be a
partition of unity.
     
(a) If $B$ is another partition of unity in $\frak A$, then
     
\Centerline{$H(A|\frak B)\le H(A\vee B|\frak B)
\le H(A|\frak B)+H(B|\frak B)$.}
     
(b) If $\frak B$ is purely atomic and $D$ is the set of its atoms, then
$H(A\vee D)=H(D)+H(A|\frak B)$.
     
(c) If $\frak C\subseteq\frak B$ is a smaller closed subalgebra of
$\frak A$, then $H(A|\frak C)\ge H(A|\frak B)$.   In particular,
$H(A)\ge H(A|\frak B)$.
     
(d) Suppose that $\sequencen{\frak B_n}$ is a non-decreasing sequence of
closed subalgebras of $\frak A$ such that
$\frak B=\overline{\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}\frak B_n}$.   If $H(A)<\infty$
then
     
\Centerline{$H(A|\frak B)=\lim_{n\to\infty}H(A|\frak B_n)$.}

\noindent where all the infinite sums are to be regarded as
order*-limits of the corresponding finite sums (see \S367), and the
middle inequality is a consequence of 385A(f-ii).   Accordingly
     
$$\eqalign{H(A\vee B|\frak B)
&=\sum_{a\in A,b\in B,a\Bcap b\ne 0}\int\bar q(P\chi(a\Bcap b))\cr

\ge\sum_{a\in A}\int\bar q(P\chi a)
=H(A|\frak B).\cr}$$
     
\medskip
     
\quad{\bf (ii)} Suppose for the moment that $A$ and $B$ are both finite.
For $a\in\frak A$ set
$u_a=P(\chi a)$.   If $a$, $b\in\frak A$ we have
$0\le u_{a\Bcap b}\le u_b$ in $L^0(\frak B)$, so we may choose
$v_{ab}\in L^0(\frak B)$ such
that $0\le v_{ab}\le\chi 1$ and $u_{a\Bcap b}=v_{ab}\times u_b$.
     
For any $b\in B$, $\sum_{a\in A}u_{a\Bcap b}=u_b$ (because
$\sum_{a\in A}\chi(a\Bcap b)=\chi b$), so
$u_b\times\sum_{a\in A}v_{ab}=u_b$.
Since $\Bvalue{|\bar q(u_b)|>0}\Bsubseteq\Bvalue{u_b>0}$,
$\bar q(u_b)\times\sum_{a\in A}v_{ab}=\bar q(u_b)$.
     
For any $a\in A$,
     
$$\eqalignno{\bar q(u_a)

\noalign{\noindent (because $v_{ab}\in L^0(\frak B)$ for every $b$, so
$P(\chi b\times v_{ab})=P(\chi b)\times v_{ab}$)}

Putting these together,
     
$$\eqalignno{H(A\vee B|\frak B)

\quad{\bf (iii)} For general partitions of unity $A$ and $B$, take any
finite set $C\subseteq A\vee B$.   Then
$C\subseteq\{a\Bcap b:a\in A_0,\,b\in B_0\}$ where $A_0\subseteq A$ and
$B_0\subseteq B$ are finite.   Set
     
\Centerline{$A'=A_0\cup\{1\Bsetminus\sup A_0\}$,
\quad$B'=B_0\cup\{1\Bsetminus\sup B_0\}$,}

$C\subseteq A'\vee B'$.   Now

\medskip
     
{\bf (b)} It follows from 385Ab that
$\sum_{d\in D}q(\bar\mu(a\Bcap d))\ge q(\bar\mu a)$ for any $a\in A$.
     
Now, because $\frak B$ is purely atomic and $D$ is its set of atoms,
     
\Centerline{$P(\chi a)
=\sum_{d\in D}\Bover{\bar\mu(a\Bcap d)}{\bar\mu d}\chi d$,
\quad$\bar q(P(\chi a))

\Centerline{$H(A|\frak B)
=\sum_{a\in A,d\in D}q(\Bover{\bar\mu(a\Bcap d)}{\bar\mu d})\bar\mu d$.}
     
\noindent Putting these together,
     
$$\eqalignno{H(A\vee D)
&=\sum_{a\in A,d\in D} q(\bar\mu(a\Bcap d))

\medskip
     
{\bf (c)} Write $P_{\frak C}$ for the conditional expectation operator
corresponding to $\frak C$.   If $a\in\frak A$,
     
\Centerline{$\bar q(P_{\frak C}\chi a)
=\bar q(P_{\frak C}P\chi a)
\ge P_{\frak C}\bar q(P\chi a)$}
     
\noindent by 385B.   So
     
\Centerline{$H(A|\frak C)=\sum_{a\in A}$$\textfont3=\twelveex \int\bar

=H(A|\frak B)$.}
     
Taking $\frak C=\{0,1\}$, we get $H(A)\ge H(A|\frak B)$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (d)} Let $P_n$ be the conditional expectation operator
corresponding to $\frak B_n$, for each $n$.   Fix $a\in A$.   Then
$P(\chi a)$ is the order*-limit of $\sequencen{P_n(\chi a)}$, by
L\'evy's martingale theorem (367Jb).
Consequently (because $q$ is continuous)
$\sequencen{\bar q(P_n\chi a)}$ is order*-convergent to
$\bar q(P\chi a)$ for every $a\in A$ (367H).   Also,
because $0\le P_n\chi a\le\chi 1$ for every $n$,
$0\le\bar q(P_n\chi a)\le\bover1e\chi 1$ for every $n$.   By the
Dominated Convergence Theorem (367I),
$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int\bar q(P_n\chi a)=\int\bar q(P\chi a)$.
     
By 385B, we also have
     
\Centerline{$ 0\le\int\bar q(P_n\chi a)\le q(\int
P_n(\chi a))
=q(\int\chi a)=q(\bar\mu a)$}
     
\noindent for every $a\in A$ and $n\in\Bbb N$;  since also
     
\Centerline{$ 0\le\int\bar q(P\chi a)=q(\bar\mu

\noindent we have
$|\int\bar q(P_n\chi a)-\int\bar q(P\chi a)|\le q(\bar\mu a)$ for every
$a\in A$, $n\in\Bbb N$.
     
Now we are supposing that $H(A)$ is finite.   Given
$\epsilon>0$, we can find a finite set $I\subseteq A$ such that
$\sum_{a\in A\setminus I}q(\bar\mu a)\le\epsilon$, and an $n_0\in\Bbb N$
such that
     
\Centerline{$\sum_{a\in I}
 $$\textfont3=\twelveex |\int\bar q(P_n\chi a)-\int\bar q(P\chi

Let $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$ be a probability algebra

with root algebra $\frak A_0$.
     
(i) If $\frak A_0$ is purely atomic, then $h(\pi)=H(A)$, where $A$ is
the set of atoms of $\frak A_0$.
     
(ii) If $\frak A_0$ is not purely atomic, then $h(\pi)=\infty$.
     
\proof{{\bf (a)} The point is that for any partition of unity
$C\subseteq\frak A_0\setminus\{0\}$, $h(\pi,C)=H(C)$.  \Prf\ For any $n\ge 1$,
$D_n(C,\pi)$ is the partition of unity consisting of elements of the

\Qed}
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (b)} If $\frak A_0$ is purely atomic and $H(A)<\infty$, the result
can now be read off from 385P, because the closed subalgebra of $\frak
A$
generated by $A$ is $\frak A_0$ and the closed subalgebra of $\frak A$
generated by $\bigcup_{k\in\Bbb N}\pi^k[A]$ or $\bigcup_{k\in\Bbb

\medskip
     
{\bf (c)} Otherwise, 385J tells us that there are finite partitions of
unity $C\subseteq\frak A_0$ such that $H(C)$ is arbitrarily large.
Since $h(\pi)\ge h(\pi,C)=H(C)$ for any such $C$, by (a) and the

\prooflet{
\Prf{\bf (i)} Given a probability algebra $(\frak A_0,\bar\mu_0)$ then
we can identify it with the measure algebra of a probability space
$(X,\Sigma,\mu_0)$ (321J), and now the constructions of (a) and (b)
provide Bernoulli shifts with root algebras isomorphic to
$(\frak A_0,\bar\mu_0)$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (ii)} Let $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$ and $(\frak B,\bar\nu)$ be
probability algebras with one-sided Bernoulli shifts $\pi$, $\phi$ with
root algebras $\frak A_0$, $\frak B_0$, and suppose that
$\theta_0:\frak A_0\to\frak B_0$ is a measure-preserving isomorphism.
Then $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$ can be identified with the probability algebra
free product
of $\sequence{k}{\pi^k[\frak A_0]}$ (325L), while $(\frak B,\bar\nu)$
can be identified with the probability algebra free product of
$\sequence{k}{\pi^k[\frak B_0]}$.   For each $k\in\Bbb N$,
$\phi^k\theta_0(\pi^k)^{-1}$ is a measure-preserving isomorphism between
$\pi^k[\frak A_0]$ and $\phi^k[\frak B_0]$.   Assembling these, we have
a measure-preserving isomorphism $\theta:\frak A\to\frak B$ such that
$\theta a=\phi^k\theta_0(\pi^k)^{-1}a$ whenever $k\in\Bbb N$ and
$a\in\pi^k[\frak A_0]$, that is, $\theta\pi^ka=\phi^k\theta_0a$ for
every
$a\in\frak A_0$, $k\in\Bbb N$.   Of course $\theta$ extends $\theta_0$.
     
If we set
     
\Centerline{$\frak C=\{a:a\in\frak A,\,\theta\pi a=\phi\theta a\}$,}
     
\noindent then $\frak C$ is a closed subalgebra of $\frak A$.   If

=\phi(\phi^k\theta_0a)=\phi\theta(\pi^ka)$,}
     
\noindent so $\pi^ka\in\frak C$.   Thus $\phi^k[\frak A_0]\subseteq\frak
C$ for every $k\in\Bbb N$, and $\frak C=\frak A$.
     
This means that $\theta:\frak A\to\frak B$ is such that
$\phi=\theta\pi\theta^{-1}$;  $\theta$ is an isomorphism between the

\spheader 385Sd The classic problem to which the theory of this section
was directed was the following:  suppose we have two two-sided Bernoulli
shifts $\pi$ and $\phi$, one based on a root algebra with two atoms of
measure $\bover12$ and the other on a root algebra with three atoms of
measure $\bover13$;  are they isomorphic?   The Kolmogorov-Sina\v\i\
theorem tells us that they are not, because $h(\pi)=\ln 2$ and
$h(\phi)=\ln 3$ are different.   \cmmnt{The question of which
Bernoulli shifts
{\it are} isomorphic is addressed, and (for countably-generated
algebras) solved, in \S387 below.}
     
\spheader 385Se We shall need to know that any Bernoulli shift (either
one- or two-sided) is ergodic.   In fact, it is mixing.
\prooflet{\Prf\ Let $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$
be a probability algebra and $\pi:\frak A\to\frak A$ a Bernoulli shift
with root algebra $\frak A_0$.   Let $\frak B$ be the subalgebra of
$\frak A$ generated by $\bigcup_{k\in\Bbb N}\pi^k[\frak A_0]$ (if $\pi$
is one-sided) or by $\bigcup_{k\in\Bbb Z}\pi^k[\frak A_0]$ (if $\pi$ is
two-sided).   If $b$, $c\in\frak B$, there is some $n\in\Bbb N$ such
that both belong to the algebra $\frak B_n$ generated by
$\bigcup_{j\le n}\pi^j[\frak A_0]$ (if $\pi$ is one-sided) or by
$\bigcup_{|j|\le
n}\pi^j[\frak A_0]$ (if $\pi$ is two-sided).   If now $k>2n$, $\pi^kb$
belongs to the algebra generated by $\bigcup_{j>n}\pi^j[\frak A_0]$.
But this is independent of $\frak B_n$ (cf.\ 325Xg, 272K), so
     
\Centerline{$\bar\mu(c\Bcap\pi^kb)=\bar\mu c\cdot\bar\mu(\pi^k b)
=\bar\mu c\cdot\bar\mu b$.}
     
\noindent And this is true for every $k\ge n$.   Generally, if $b$,
$c\in\frak A$ and $\epsilon>0$, there are $b'$, $c'\in\frak B$ such that
$\bar\mu(b\Bsymmdiff b')\le\epsilon$ and
$\bar\mu(c\Bsymmdiff c')\le\epsilon$, so that
     
$$\eqalign{\limsup_{k\to\infty}
  |\bar\mu(c\Bcap\pi^kb)-\bar\mu c\cdot\bar\mu b|
&\le\limsup_{k\to\infty}
  |\bar\mu(c'\Bcap\pi^kb')-\bar\mu c'\cdot\bar\mu b'|\cr

&\le 0+\epsilon+\epsilon+|\bar\mu c-\bar\mu c'|
  +|\bar\mu b-\bar\mu b'|
\le 4\epsilon.\cr}$$
     
\noindent As $\epsilon$, $b$ and $c$ are arbitrary, $\pi$ is mixing.
By 372Qa, it is ergodic.\ \Qed

\leader{385T}{Isomorphic homomorphisms (a)} %(2002) 3{}84T
In this
section I have spoken of `isomorphic homomorphisms' without offering a
formal definition.   I hope that my intention was indeed obvious, and
that the next sentence will merely confirm what you have already
assumed.   If $(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1)$ and $(\frak A_2,\bar\mu_2)$ are
measure algebras, and $\pi_1:\frak A_1\to\frak A_2$,
$\pi_2:\frak A_2\to\frak A_2$ are functions, then I say that
$(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1,\pi_1)$ and $(\frak A_2,\bar\mu_2,\pi_2)$ are
isomorphic if there is a measure-preserving isomorphism
$\phi:\frak A_1\to\frak A_2$ such that $\pi_2=\phi\pi_1\phi^{-1}$.   In
this context, using
Maharam's theorem or otherwise, we can expect to be able to decide
whether $(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1)$ and $(\frak A_2,\bar\mu_2)$ are or are
not isomorphic;  and if they are, we have a good hope of being able to
describe a measure-preserving isomorphism
$\theta:\frak A_1\to\frak A_2$.   In this case, of course,
$(\frak A_2,\bar\mu_2,\pi_2)$ will be
isomorphic to $(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1,\pi'_2)$ where
$\pi'_2=\theta^{-1}\pi_2\theta$.   So now we have to decide whether
$(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1,\pi_1)$ is isomorphic to
$(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1,\pi'_2)$;  and when $\pi_1$, $\pi_2$ are
measure-preserving Boolean automorphisms, this is just the question of
whether $\pi_1$, $\pi'_2$ are conjugate in the group
$\Aut_{\bar\mu_1}(\frak A_1)$ of measure-preserving automorphisms of
$\frak A_1$.   Thus the isomorphism problem, as stated here, is very
close to the classical group-theoretic problem of identifying the
conjugacy classes in $\Aut_{\bar\mu}(\frak A)$ for a measure algebra
$(\frak A,\bar\mu)$.   But we also want to look at
measure-preserving homomorphisms which are not automorphisms, so there
would be something left even if the conjugacy problem were solved.   (In
effect, we are studying conjugacy in the semigroup of all
measure-preserving Boolean homomorphisms, not just in its group of
invertible elements.)
     
The point of the calculation of the entropy of a homomorphism is that it
is an invariant under this kind of isomorphism;  so that if $\pi_1$,
$\pi_2$ have different entropies then $(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1,\pi_1)$ and
$(\frak A_2,\bar\mu_2,\pi_2)$ cannot be isomorphic.   Of course the
properties of being `ergodic' or `mixing' (see 372O) are also
invariant.
     
\spheader 385Tb All the main work of this section has been done in terms
of measure algebras;  part of my purpose in this volume has been to
insist that this is often the right way to proceed, and to establish a
language which makes the arguments smooth and natural.   But of course a
large proportion of the most important homomorphisms arise in the
context of measure spaces, and I take a moment to discuss such
applications.   Suppose that we have two quadruples
$(X_1,\Sigma_1,\mu_1,f_1)$ and $(X_2,\Sigma_2,\mu_2,f_2)$ where, for each $i$, $(X_i,\Sigma_i,\mu_i)$ is a measure space and $f_i:X_i\to X_i$ is an \imp\ function.   Then we have associated structures
$(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1,\pi_1)$ and $(\frak A_2,\bar\mu_2,\pi_2)$ where $(\frak A_i,\bar\mu_i)$ is the measure algebra of $(X_i,\Sigma_i,\mu_i)$ and $\pi_i:\frak A_i\to\frak A_i$ is the measure-preserving homomorphism
defined by the usual formula
$\pi_iE^{\ssbullet}=f_i^{-1}[E]^{\ssbullet}$.
Now we can call $(X_1,\Sigma_1,\mu_1,f_1)$ and
$(X_2,\Sigma_2,\mu_2,f_2)$ isomorphic if there is a measure space
isomorphism $g:X_1\to X_2$ such that $f_2=gf_1g^{-1}$.   In this case
$(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1,\pi_1)$ and $(\frak A_2,\bar\mu_2,\pi_2)$ are
isomorphic under the obvious isomorphism
$\phi(E^{\ssbullet})=g[E]^{\ssbullet}$ for every $E\in\Sigma_1$.
     
It is not the case that if the $(\frak A_i,\bar\mu_i,\pi_i)$ are
isomorphic, then the $(X_i,\Sigma_i,\mu_i,f_i)$ are;  in fact we do not
even need to have an isomorphism of the measure spaces (for instance,
one could be Lebesgue measure, and the other the Stone space of the
Lebesgue measure algebra).   Even when $(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1,\pi_1)$ and
$(\frak A_2,\bar\mu_2,\pi_2)$ are actually identical, $f_1$ and $f_2$
need not be isomorphic.   There are two examples in \S343 of a
probability space $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ with a measure space automorphism
$f:X\to X$ such that $f(x)\ne x$ for every $x\in X$ but the
corresponding automorphism on the measure algebra is the identity
(343I, 343J);  writing $\iota$ for the identity map from $X$ to itself,
$(X,\Sigma,\mu,\iota)$ and $(X,\Sigma,\mu,f)$ are non-isomorphic but give 
rise to the same $(\frak A,\bar\mu,\pi)$.
     
\spheader 385Tc Even with Lebesgue measure, we can have a problem in a
formal sense.   Take $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ to be $[0,1]$ with Lebesgue
measure, and set $f(0)=1$, $f(1)=0$, $f(x)=x$ for $x\in\ooint{0,1}$;
then $f$ is not isomorphic to the identity function on $X$, but induces
the identity automorphism on the measure algebra.   But in this case we
can sort things out just by discarding the negligible set $\{0,1\}$, and
for Lebesgue measure such a procedure is effective in a wide variety of
situations.   To formalize it I offer the following definition.

\leader{385U}{Definition} %(2002) 3{}84U
Let $(X_1,\Sigma_1,\mu_1)$ and
$(X_2,\Sigma_2,\mu_2)$ be measure spaces, and $f_1:X_1\to X_1$,
$f_2:X_2\to X_2$ two \imp\ functions.   I will say that the structures
$(X_1,\Sigma_1,\mu_1,f_1)$ and $(X_2,\Sigma_2,\mu_2,f_2)$ are {\bf
almost isomorphic} if there are conegligible sets $X_i'\subseteq X_i$
such that $f_i[X'_i]\subseteq X'_i$ for both $i$ and the structures
$(X'_i,\Sigma'_i,\mu'_i,f'_i)$ are isomorphic\cmmnt{ in the sense of
385Tb}, where $\Sigma'_i$ is the algebra of relatively measurable
subsets of $X'_i$, $\mu'_i$ is the subspace measure on $X'_i$ and
$f'_i=f_i\restr X'_i$.

leave the elementary properties of this
notion to the exercises (385Xn-385Xp), but I spell out the result for
which the definition is devised.   I phrase it in the language of
\S\S342-343;  if the terms are not immediately familiar, start by
imagining that both
$(X_i,\Sigma_i,\mu_i)$ are measurable subspaces of $\Bbb R$ endowed with
some Radon measure (342J, 343H), or indeed that both are $[0,1]$
with Lebesgue measure.
     
\medskip
     
\noindent}{\bf Proposition} Let $(X_1,\Sigma_1,\mu_1)$ and
$(X_2,\Sigma_2,\mu_2)$ be perfect, complete, strictly localizable and
countably separated measure spaces, and $(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1)$,
$(\frak A_2,\bar\mu_2)$ their measure algebras.   Suppose that
$f_1:X_1\to X_1$, $f_2:X_2\to X_2$ are \imp\ functions and that
$\pi_1:\frak A_1\to\frak A_1$, $\pi_2:\frak A_2\to\frak A_2$ are the
measure-preserving Boolean
homomorphisms they induce.   If $(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1,\pi_1)$ and
$(\frak A_2,\bar\mu_2,\pi_2)$ are isomorphic, then
$(X_1,\Sigma_1,\mu_1,f_1)$ and $(X_2,\Sigma_2,\mu_2,f_2)$ are almost
isomorphic.
     
\proof{ Because $(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1)$ and $(\frak A_2,\bar\mu_2)$ are
isomorphic, we surely have $\mu_1X_1=\mu_2X_2$.   If both are zero, we
can take $X'_1=X'_2=\emptyset$ and stop;  so let us suppose that
$\mu_1X_1>0$.   Let $\phi:\frak A_1\to\frak A_2$ be a measure-preserving
automorphism such that $\pi_2=\phi\pi_1\phi^{-1}$.   Because both
$\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are complete and strictly localizable and compact
(343K), there are \imp\ functions $g_1:X_1\to X_2$ and $g_2:X_2\to X_1$
representing
$\phi^{-1}$, $\phi$ respectively (343B).   Now $g_1g_2:X_2\to X_2$,
$g_2g_1:X_1\to X_1$, $f_2g_1:X_1\to X_2$ and $g_1f_1:X_1\to X_2$
represent, respectively, the identity automorphism on $\frak A_2$, the
identity automorphism on $\frak A_1$, the homomorphism
$\phi^{-1}\pi_2=\pi_1\phi^{-1}:\frak A_2\to\frak A_1$ and the
homomorphism $\pi_1\phi^{-1}$ again.   Next, because
both $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are countably separated, the sets
$E_1=\{x:g_2g_1(x)=x\}$, $H=\{x:f_2g_1(x)=g_1f_1(x)\}$ and
$E_2=\{y:g_1g_2(y)=y\}$ are all conegligible (343F).   As in part (b) of
the proof of 344I, $g_1\restr E_1$ and $g_2\restr E_2$ are the two
halves of a bijection, a measure space isomorphism if $E_1$ and $E_2$
are given their subspace measures.   Set $G_0=E_1\cap H$, and for
$n\in\Bbb N$ set
$G_{n+1}=G_n\cap f_1^{-1}[G_n]$.   Then every $G_n$ is conegligible, so
$X'_1=\bigcap_{n\in\Bbb N}G_n$ is conegligible.   Because $X'_1$ is a
conegligible subset of $E_1$, $h=g_1\restr X'_1$ is a measure space
isomorphism between $X'_1$ and $X'_2=g_1[X'_1]$, which is conegligible
in $X_2$.    Because $f_1[G_{n+1}]\subseteq G_n$ for each $n$,
$f_1[X'_1]\subseteq X'_1$.   Because $X'_1\subseteq H$,
$g_1f_1(x)=f_2g_1(x)$ for every $x\in X'_1$.   Next, if $y\in X'_2$,
$g_2(y)\in X'_1$, so
     
\Centerline{$f_2(y)=f_2g_1g_2(y)=g_1f_1g_2(y)\in g_1[f_1[X'_1]]
\subseteq g_1[X'_1]=X'_2$.}
     
\noindent Accordingly we have $f'_2=hf'_1h^{-1}$, where $f'_i=f_i\restr
X'_i$ for both $i$.
     
Thus $h$ is an isomorphism between $(X'_1,f'_1)$ and $(X'_2,f'_2)$, and
$(X_1,\Sigma_1,\mu_1,f_1)$ and $(X_2,\Sigma_2,\mu_2,f_2)$ are almost
isomorphic.

\cmmnt{
\Notesheader{385} In preparing this section I have been heavily
influenced by {\smc Petersen 83}.   I have taken almost the shortest
possible route to Theorem 385P, the original application of the theory,
ignoring both the many extensions of these ideas and their intuitive
underpinning in the concept of the quantity of `information' carried
by a partition.   For both of these I refer you to {\smc Petersen 83}.
The techniques described there are I think sufficiently powerful to make
possible the calculation of the entropy of any of the measure-preserving
homomorphisms which have yet appeared in this treatise.
     
Of course the idea of entropy of a partition, or of a homomorphism, can
be translated into the language of probability spaces and \imp\
functions;  if $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ is a probability space, with measure
algebra $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$, then partitions of unity in $\frak A$
correspond (subject to decisions on how to treat negligible sets) to
countable partitions of $X$ into measurable sets, and an \imp\ function
$f:X\to X$ gives rise to a measure-preserving homomorphism
$\pi_f:\frak A\to\frak A$;  so we can define the entropy of $f$ to be
$h(\pi_f)$.   The whole point of the language I have sought to develop
in this volume is that we can do this when and if we choose;  in
particular, we are not limited to those homomorphisms which are
representable by \imp\ functions.   But of course a large proportion of
the most important examples do arise in this way (see 385Xj, 385Xk).
The same two examples are instructive from another point of view:  the
case $k=2$ of 385Xj is (almost) isomorphic to the tent map of 385Xk.
The similarity is obvious, but exhibiting an actual isomorphism is I
think another matter (385Yg).
     
I must say `almost' isomorphic here because the doubling map on
$\coint{0,1}$ is everywhere two-to-one, while the tent map is not, so
they cannot be isomorphic in any exact sense.   This is the problem
grappled with in 385T-385V.   In some moods I would say that a dislike
of such contortions is a sign of civilized taste.   Certainly it is part
of my motivation for working with measure algebras whenever possible.
But I have to say also that new ideas in this topic arise more often
than not from actual measure spaces, and that it is absolutely necessary
to be able to operate in the more concrete context.
