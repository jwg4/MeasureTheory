I have repeatedly said that any satisfactory classification theorem for
automorphisms of measure algebras remains elusive.   There is however a
classification, at least for the Lebesgue measure algebra, of the
`orbit structures' corresponding to measure-preserving automorphisms;
in fact, they are defined by the fixed-point subalgebras, which I
described in \S333.   We have to work hard for this result,
but the ideas are instructive.
     
\leader{388A}{Orbit \dvrocolon{structures}}\cmmnt{ I %3{8}7C
said that this
section was directed to a classification of `orbit structures',
without saying what these might be.   In fact what I will do is to
classify the full subgroups generated by measure-preserving
automorphisms of the Lebesgue measure algebra.   One aspect of the
relation with `orbits' is the following.   (Cf.\ 381Qc.)
     
\medskip
     
\noindent}{\bf Proposition} Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a
localizable countably separated
measure space\cmmnt{ (definition:  343D)}, with measure algebra
$(\frak A,\bar\mu)$.   Suppose that
$f$ and $g$ are measure space automorphisms from $X$ to itself, inducing
measure-preserving automorphisms $\pi$, $\phi$ of $\frak A$.   Then the
following are equiveridical:
     
(i) $\phi$ belongs to the full subgroup of $\Aut\frak A$ generated by
$\pi$;
     
(ii) for almost every $x\in X$, there is an $n\in\Bbb Z$ such that
$g(x)=f^n(x)$;
     
(iii) for almost every $x\in X$,
$\{g^n(x):n\in\Bbb Z\}\subseteq\{f^n(x):n\in\Bbb Z\}$.
     
\proof{{\bf(i)$\Rightarrow$(ii)} Let $\sequence{k}{H_k}$ be a sequence
in $\Sigma$ which separates the points of $X$;  we may suppose that
$H_0=X$.   By 381Ib, there is a partition of unity
$\langle a_n\rangle_{n\in\Bbb Z}$ in $\frak A$ such that
$\phi c=\pi^nc$ for every $c\Bsubseteq a_n$, $n\in\Bbb Z$.   For each
$n\in\Bbb Z$ let $E_n\in\Sigma$ be such that $E_n^{\ssbullet}=a_n$;
then $Y_0= \bigcup_{n\in \Bbb Z}E_n$ is conegligible.   The
transformation $f^n$
induces $\pi^n$, so for any $k\in\Bbb N$ and $n\in\Bbb Z$ the set
     
$$\eqalign{F_{nk}
&=\{x:f^n(x)\in E_n\cap H_k,\,g(x)\notin E_n\cap H_k\}\cr
&\qquad\qquad\qquad
\cup\{x:g(x)\in E_n\cap H_k,\,f^n(x)\notin E_n\cap H_k\}\cr}$$
     
\noindent is negligible, and
$Y=g^{-1}[Y_0]\setminus\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb Z,k\in\Bbb N}F_{nk}$ is
conegligible.   Now, for any $x\in Y$, there is
some $n$ such that $g(x)\in E_n$, so that $f^n(x)\in E_n$ and
$\{k:g(x)\in H_k\}=\{k:f^n(x)\in H_k\}$
and $g(x)=f^n(x)$.   As $Y$ is conegligible, (ii) is satisfied.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (ii)$\Rightarrow$(iii)} For $x\in X$, set
$\Omega_x=\{f^n(x):n\in\Bbb Z\}$;
we are supposing that $A_0=\{x:g(x)\notin \Omega_x\}$ is negligible.
Set $A=\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb Z}g^{-n}[A_0]$, so that $A$ is negligible and
$g^n(x)\in X\setminus A$ for every $x\in X\setminus A$, $n\in\Bbb Z$.
     
Suppose that $x\in X\setminus A$ and $n\in\Bbb N$.   Then
$g^n(x)\in \Omega_x$.   \Prf\ Induce on $n$.   Of course
$g^0(x)=x\in \Omega_x$.   For the inductive
step to $n+1$, $g^n(x)\in\Omega_x\setminus A_0$,
so there is a $k\in\Bbb Z$ such that $g^n(x)=f^k(x)$.   At the same
time, there is an $i\in\Bbb Z$ such that $g(g^n(x))=f^i(g^n(x))$,
so that $g^{n+1}(x)=f^{i+k}(x)\in \Omega_x$.   Thus the induction
continues.\ \Qed
     
Consequently $g^{-n}(x)\in \Omega_x$ whenever $x\in X\setminus A$ and
$n\in\Bbb N$.   \Prf\ Since $g^{-n}(x)\in X\setminus A$, there is a
$k\in\Bbb Z$ such that $x=g^ng^{-n}(x)=f^kg^{-n}(x)$ and
$g^{-n}(x)=f^{-k}(x)\in\Omega_x$.\ \Qed
     
Thus $\{g^n(x):n\in\Bbb Z\}\subseteq \Omega_x$ for every $x$ in the
conegligible set $X\setminus A$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (iii)$\Rightarrow$(ii)} is trivial.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (ii)$\Rightarrow$(i)} Set
     
\Centerline{$E_n=\{x:g(x)=f^n(x)\}
=X\setminus\bigcup_{k\in\Bbb N}(g^{-1}[H_k]\symmdiff f^{-n}[H_k])$,}
     
\noindent for $n\in\Bbb Z$.
Then (ii) tells us that $\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb Z}
E_n$ is conegligible, so $\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb Z}g[E_n]$ is conegligible.
But also each $E_n$ is measurable, so $g[E_n]$ also is, and we can set
$a_n=g[E_n]^{\ssbullet}$.   Now for $y\in g[E_n]$, $y=f^n(g^{-1}(y))$,
that is, $g^{-1}(y)=f^{-n}(y)$;  so $\phi a=\pi^na$ for every
$a\Bsubseteq a_n$.   Since $\sup_{n\in\Bbb Z}a_n=1$ in $\frak A$, $\phi$
belongs to the full subgroup generated by $\pi$.
}%end of proof of 388A
     
\cmmnt{\medskip
     
\noindent{\bf Remark} Of course the requirement `countably separated'
is essential here;  for other measure spaces we can have $\phi$ and
$\pi$ actually equal without $g(x)$ and $f(x)$ being related for any
particular $x$ (see 343I and 343J).
}%end of comment
     
\leader{388B}{Corollary} %3{8}7D
Under the hypotheses of 388A, $\pi$ and $\phi$
generate the same full subgroup of $\Aut\frak A$ iff
$\{f^n(x):n\in\Bbb Z\}=\{g^n(x):n\in\Bbb Z\}$ for almost every $x\in X$.
     
\leader{388C}{}\cmmnt{ Extending some ideas %3{8}7F
from 381M-381N, we have the following fact.
     
\medskip
     
\noindent}{\bf Lemma} Let $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$ be a totally finite
measure algebra, and $\pi:\frak A\to\frak A$ a measure-preserving
automorphism;  let $\frak C$ be its fixed-point subalgebra
$\{c:\pi c=c\}$.
Let $\langle d_i\rangle_{i\in I}$, $\langle e_i\rangle_{i\in I}$ be two
disjoint families in $\frak A$ such that
$\bar\mu(c\Bcap d_i)=\bar\mu(c\Bcap e_i)$ for every $i\in I$ and
$c\in\frak C$.   Then there is a $\phi\in G_{\pi}$, the full subgroup of
$\Aut\frak A$ generated by $\pi$, such that $\phi d_i=e_i$ for every
$i\in I$.
     
\proof{ Adding $d^*=1\Bsetminus\sup_{i\in I}d_i$,
$e^*=1\Bsetminus\sup_{i\in I}e_i$ to the respective families, we may
suppose that $\langle d_i\rangle_{i\in I}$, $\langle e_i\rangle_{i\in
I}$ are partitions of unity.
Define $\sequencen{a_n}$ inductively by the formula
     
\Centerline{$a_n
=\sup_{i\in I}(d_i\setminus\sup_{m<n}a_m)
  \Bcap\pi^{-n}(e_i\Bsetminus\sup_{m<n}\pi^ma_m)$.}
     
\noindent Then $a_n\Bcap d_i\Bcap a_m=0$ whenever $m<n$ and $i\in I$,
so $\sequencen{a_n}$ is disjoint.   Also
     
\Centerline{$\pi^na_n
\Bsubseteq\sup_{i\in I}e_i\Bsetminus\sup_{m<n}\pi^ma_m$}
     
\noindent for each $n$, so $\sequencen{\pi^na_n}$ is disjoint.   Note
that as $\pi^n(a_n\Bcap d_j)\Bsubseteq e_j$ for each $j$,
     
$$\eqalign{\pi^na_n\Bcap e_i
&=\sup_{j\in I}\pi^n(a_n\Bcap d_j)\Bcap e_i
=\sup_{j\in I}\pi^n(a_n\Bcap d_j)\Bcap e_j\Bcap e_i\cr
&=\pi^n(a_n\Bcap d_i)\Bcap e_i
=\pi^n(a_n\Bcap d_i)\cr}$$
     
\noindent for every $i\in I$ and $n\in\Bbb N$.
     
\Quer\ Suppose, if possible, that $a=1\Bsetminus \sup_{n\in\Bbb N}a_n$
is non-zero.   Then there is an $i\in I$ such that $a\Bcap d_i\ne 0$.
Set $c=\sup_{n\in\Bbb N}\pi^n(a\Bcap d_i)$;  then $\pi c\Bsubseteq c$
so $c\in\frak C$.   Now
     
$$\eqalign{\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bar\mu(c\Bcap e_i\Bcap\pi^na_n)
&=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bar\mu(c\Bcap\pi^n(a_n\Bcap d_i))
=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bar\mu(\pi^n(c\Bcap a_n\Bcap d_i))\cr
&=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bar\mu(c\Bcap a_n\Bcap d_i)
=\bar\mu(c\Bcap d_i\Bsetminus a)
<\bar\mu(c\Bcap d_i)
=\bar\mu(c\Bcap e_i).\cr}$$
     
\noindent So $b=c\Bcap e_i\Bsetminus\sup_{n\in\Bbb N}\pi^na_n$ is
non-zero, and there is an $n\in\Bbb N$ such that
$b\Bcap\pi^n(a\Bcap d_i)$
is non-zero.   But look at $a'=\pi^{-n}(b\Bcap\pi^n(a\Bcap d_i))$.
We have $0\ne a'\Bsubseteq a\Bcap d_i$, so
$a'\Bsubseteq d_i\Bsetminus \sup_{m<n}a_m$;  while
     
\Centerline{$\pi^na'\Bsubseteq b
  \Bsubseteq e_i\Bsetminus\sup_{m<n}\pi^ma_m$.}
     
\noindent But this means that $a'\Bsubseteq a_n$, which is absurd.\
\Bang
     
This shows that $\sequencen{a_n}$ is a partition of unity in $\frak A$.
Since
     
\Centerline{$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bar\mu(\pi^na_n)
=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bar\mu a_n=\bar\mu 1$,}
     
\noindent $\sequencen{\pi^na_n}$ also is a partition of unity.   We can
therefore define $\phi\in G_{\pi}$ by setting $\phi d=\pi^nd$ whenever
$n\in\Bbb N$ and $d\Bsubseteq a_n$.   Now, for any $i\in I$,
     
\Centerline{$\phi d_i=\sup_{n\in\Bbb N}\phi(d_i\Bcap a_n)
=\sup_{n\in\Bbb N}\pi^n(d_i\Bcap a_n)
=\sup_{n\in\Bbb N}e_i\Bcap\pi^na_n=e_i$.}
     
\noindent So we have found a suitable $\phi$.

\leader{388D}{von Neumann automorphisms:  Definitions (a)} %3{8}7G
Let $\frak A$ be a Boolean algebra and $\pi\in\Aut\frak A$ an
automorphism.   $\pi$ is {\bf weakly von Neumann} if there is a
sequence $\sequencen{a_n}$ in $\frak A$ such that $a_0=1$ and,
for every $n$, $a_{n+1}\Bcap\pi^{2^n}a_{n+1}=0$,
$a_{n+1}\Bcup\pi^{2^n}a_{n+1}=a_n$.
In this case, $\pi$ is {\bf von Neumann} if $\sequencen{a_n}$ can be
chosen in such a way that
$\{\pi^ma_n:m$, $n\in\Bbb N\}\,\,\tau$-generates $\frak A$, and
{\bf relatively von Neumann} if $\sequencen{a_n}$ can be chosen so that
$\{\pi^ma_n:m$, $n\in\Bbb N\}\cup\{c:\pi c=c\}\,\,\tau$-generates
$\frak A$.
     
\spheader 388Db \cmmnt{ There is another way of looking at
automorphisms
of this type which will be useful.}  If $\frak A$ is a Boolean algebra
and $\pi:\frak A\to\frak A$ an automorphism, then a {\bf dyadic cycle
system} for $\pi$ is a finite or infinite family
$\langle d_{mi}\rangle_{m\le n,i<2^m}$ or
$\langle d_{mi}\rangle_{m\in\Bbb N,i<2^m}$
such that ($\alpha$) for each
$m$, $\langle d_{mi}\rangle_{i<2^m}$ is a partition of unity such that
$\pi d_{mi}=d_{m,i+1}$ whenever $i<2^m-1$\cmmnt{ (so that
$\pi d_{m,2^m-1}$ must be $d_{m0}$)}
($\beta$) $d_{m0}=d_{m+1,0}\Bcup d_{m+1,2^m}$
for every $m<n$ (in the finite case) or
for every $m\in\Bbb N$ (in the infinite case).
An easy induction on $m$ shows that if $k\le m$ then
     
\Centerline{$d_{ki}=\sup\{d_{mj}:j<2^m,\,j\equiv i$ mod $2^k\}$}
     
\noindent for every $i<2^k$.
     
Conversely, if $d$ is such that $\langle\pi^jd\rangle_{j<2^n}$ is a
partition of unity in $\frak A$, then we can form a finite dyadic cycle
system $\langle d_{mi}\rangle_{m\le n,i<2^m}$ by setting
$d_{mi}=\sup\{\pi^jd:j<2^n,\,j\equiv i$ mod $2^m\}$ whenever $m\le n$
and $j<2^m$.
     
\spheader 388Dc Now an
automorphism $\pi:\frak A\to\frak A$ is weakly von Neumann iff
it has an infinite dyadic cycle system
$\langle d_{mi}\rangle_{m\in\Bbb N,i<2^m}$.   \cmmnt{(The $a_m$ of (a)
correspond to the $d_{m0}$ of (b);  starting from the definition in
(a), you must check first, by induction on $m$, that $\langle\pi^ia_m

von Neumann iff
it has a dyadic cycle system $\langle d_{mi}\rangle_{m\in\Bbb N,i<2^m}$
which $\tau$-generates $\frak A$.
     
\leader{388E}{Example}\cmmnt{ The %3{8}7H
following is the basic example of a
von Neumann transformation -- in a sense, the only example of a

$a_{n+1}$ and $\pi^{2^n}a_{n+1}$ split $a_n$ for each $n$, and
$\sequencen{a_n}$ witnesses that $\pi$ is weakly von Neumann.   Next,
inducing on $n$, we find that $\{f^{-i}[E_n]:i<2^n\}$ runs over the
basic cylinder sets of the form $\{x:x(i)=z(i)$ for every $i<n\}$
determined by coordinates less than
$n$.   Since the equivalence classes of such sets $\tau$-generate
$\frak A$ (see part (a) of the proof of 331K), $\pi$ is a von Neumann
automorphism.\ \Qed}

Since $\bar\mu(\pi_be_{mj})=\bar\mu e_{m,j+1}$, we must have

Thus $\langle e_{mi}\rangle_{m\in\Bbb N,i<2^m}$ is a dyadic cycle

Let $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$ be a totally finite
measure algebra, $\pi:\frak A\to\frak A$ an aperiodic measure-preserving
automorphism, and $\phi$ any member of the full subgroup $G_{\pi}$ of
$\Aut\frak A$ generated by $\pi$.   Suppose that
$\langle d_{mi}\rangle_{m\le n,i<2^m}$ is a finite dyadic cycle system
for $\phi$.   Then there is a
weakly von Neumann automorphism $\psi$, with dyadic cycle
system $\langle d'_{mi}\rangle_{m\in\Bbb N,i<2^m}$, such that
$G_{\psi}=G_{\pi}$, $\psi a=\phi a$ whenever $a\Bcap d_{n0}=0$, and
$d'_{mi}=d_{mi}$ whenever $m\le n$ and $i<2^m$.
     
\proof{ Write $\frak C$ for the closed subalgebra $\{c:\pi c=c\}$.
By 388F there is a $b\Bsubseteq d_{n0}$ such that
$\bar\mu(b\Bcap c)=\bover12\bar\mu(d_{n0}\Bcap c)$ for every
$c\in\frak C$ and $\pi_b:\frak A_b\to\frak A_b$ is a
weakly von Neumann automorphism.   Let
$\langle e_{ki}\rangle_{k\in\Bbb N,i<2^k}$ be a dyadic cycle system for
$\pi_b$.
     
If we define $\psi_1\in\Aut\frak A$ by setting
     
\Centerline{$\psi_1d=\pi_bd$ for $d\Bsubseteq b$,
\quad$\psi_1d=\pi_{1\Bsetminus b}d$ for $d\Bsubseteq 1\Bsetminus b$,}
     
\noindent then $\psi_1\in G_{\pi}$.   Next, for any $c\in\frak C$,
     
\Centerline{$\bar\mu(\phi^{-2^n+1}b\Bcap c)
=\bar\mu\phi^{-2^n+1}(b\Bcap c)
=\bar\mu(b\Bcap c)
=\Bover12\bar\mu(d_{n0}\Bcap c)
=\bar\mu((d_{n0}\Bsetminus b)\Bcap c)$}
     
\noindent because $\phi^{-2^n+1}\in G_{\pi}$, so $\phi^{-2^n+1}c=c$.
By 388C, there is a $\psi_2\in G_{\pi}$ such that
$\psi_2(d_{n0}\Bsetminus b)=\phi^{-2^n+1}b$.
Set $\psi_3=\phi^{-2^n+1}\psi_2^{-1}\phi^{-2^n+1}\psi_1$,
so that $\psi_3\in G_{\pi}$ and
     
\Centerline{$\psi_3b=\phi^{-2^n+1}\psi_2^{-1}\phi^{-2^n+1}b
=\phi^{-2^n+1}(d_{n0}\Bsetminus b)$.}
     
\noindent Thus $\psi_3b$ and $\psi_2(d_{n0}\Bsetminus b)$ are disjoint
and have union $\phi^{-2^n+1}d_{n0}=d_{n1}$ (if $n=0$, we must read
$d_{01}$ as $d_{00}=1$).   Accordingly we can define
$\psi\in G_{\pi}$ by setting

$$\eqalign{\psi d&=\psi_3d\text{ if }d\Bsubseteq b,\cr
&=\psi_2d\text{ if }d\Bsubseteq d_{n0}\Bsetminus b,\cr
&=\phi d\text{ if }d\Bcap d_{n0}=0.\cr}$$
     
Since $\psi d_{n0}=d_{n1}$, we have $\psi d_{ni}=\phi d_{ni}$ for
every $i<2^n$, and therefore $\psi^id_{m0}=d_{mi}$ whenever
$m\le n$ and $i<2^m$.   Looking at $\psi^{2^n}$, we have
     
\Centerline{$\psi^{2^n}d_{n0}=\phi^{2^n}d_{n0}=d_{n0}$,
\quad$\psi^{2^n}b=\phi^{2^n-1}\psi_3b=d_{n0}\Bsetminus b$,}
     
\noindent so that $\psi^{2^n}(d_{n0}\Bsetminus b)=b$ and
$\psi^{2^{n+1}}b=b$.   Accordingly
     
\Centerline{$\psi^{2^{n+1}}d
=\phi^{2^n-1}\psi_2\phi^{2^n-1}\psi_3d
=\psi_1d=\pi_bd$}
     
\noindent for every $d\Bsubseteq b$.   Also $\sup_{i<2^{n+1}}\psi^ib=1$,
so 388G tells us that $G_{\psi}=G_{\pi}$.
     
Now define $\sequence{m}{a_m}$ as follows.   For $m\le n$, $a_m=d_{m0}$;
for $m>n$, $a_m=e_{m-n-1,0}$.   Then for $m<n$ we have
     
\Centerline{$\psi^{2^m}a_{m+1}=\psi^{2^m}d_{m+1,0}
=\phi^{2^m}d_{m+1,0}=d_{m+1,2^m}=a_m\Bsetminus a_{m+1}$,}
     
\noindent for $m=n$ we have
     
\Centerline{$\psi^{2^n}a_{n+1}=\psi^{2^n}e_{00}
=\psi^{2^n}b=d_{n0}\Bsetminus b=a_n\Bsetminus a_{n+1}$,}
     
\noindent and for $m>n$ we have
     
$$\eqalign{\psi^{2^m}a_{m+1}
&=(\psi^{2^{n+1}})^{2^{m-n-1}}e_{m-n,0}
=(\pi_b)^{2^{m-n-1}}e_{m-n,0}\cr
&=e_{m-n,2^{m-n-1}}
=e_{m-n-1,0}\Bsetminus e_{m-n,0}
=a_m\Bsetminus a_{m+1}.\cr}$$
     
\noindent Thus $\sequence{m}{a_m}$ witnesses that $\psi$ is a weakly
von Neumann automorphism.   If $d'_{mi}=\psi^ia_m$ for $m\in\Bbb N$,
$i<2^m$ then $\langle d'_{mi}\rangle_{m\in\Bbb N,i<2^m}$ will be a
dyadic cycle system for $\psi$ and $d'_{mi}=d_{mi}$ for $m\le n$, as
required.

that $\bar\mu(b\Bcap c)\ge\delta\bar\mu c$ whenever $c\in\frak C$ and
$c\Bsubseteq w$.   Then there is an $e\in\frak A$ such that
$e\Bsubseteq b\Bcap w$ and $\bar\mu(e\Bcap c)=\delta\bar\mu c$ whenever

\Centerline{$\#(\{e:e\in E,\Exists i\le r,\,b_i\Bcap e\notin\frak C_e\})

\proof{{\bf (a)} Set $a=b\Bcap w$ and consider the principal ideal
$\frak A_a$ generated by $\frak A$.   We know that
$(\frak A_a,\bar\mu\restrp\frak A_a)$ is a totally finite measure
algebra (322H), and that $\frak C_a$ is a closed subalgebra of
$\frak A_a$ (333Bc);  and it is easy to see that $\frak A_a$ is
relatively atomless over $\frak C_a$.
     
Let $\theta:\frak C_w\to\frak C_a$ be the Boolean homomorphism defined
by setting $\theta c=c\Bcap b$ for $c\in\frak C_w$.   If $c\in\frak C_w$
and $\theta c=0$, then $c\in\frak C$ and
$\delta\bar\mu c\le\bar\mu(c\Bcap b)=0$, so $c=0$;  thus $\theta$ is
injective;  since it is certainly surjective, it is a Boolean
isomorphism.   We can therefore define a functional
$\nu=\bar\mu\theta^{-1}:\frak C_a\to\coint{0,\infty}$, and we shall have
$\delta\nu d\le\bar\mu d$ for every $d\in\frak C_a$.   By 331B, there is
an $e\in\frak A_a$ such that $\delta\nu d=\bar\mu(d\Bcap e)$ for every
$d\in\frak C_a$, that is, $\delta\bar\mu c=\bar\mu(c\Bcap e)$ for every
$c\in\frak C_w$, as required.

{\bf (b)(i)} Write $D$ for the set of all those $e\in\frak A$ such that
$\bar\mu(c\Bcap e)=\bover1k\bar\mu c$ for every $c\in\frak C$ and
$b_i\Bcap e\in\frak C_e$ for every $i\le r$.   Then whenever
$a\in\frak A$ and $\gamma>\bover{r+1}k$ is such that
$\mu(a\Bcap c)=\gamma\mu c$ for every $c\in\frak C$, there is an $e\in
D$ such that $e\Bsubseteq a$.   \Prf\ For $d\in\frak A$, $c\in\frak C$
set $\nu_d(c)=\bar\mu(d\Bcap c)$, so that
$\nu_d:\frak C\to\coint{0,\infty}$ is a completely additive functional.
For $i\le r$ set
$v_i=\Bvalue{\bar\mu\restrp\frak C>k\nu_{a\Bcap b_i}}$, in the notation
of 326T;  so that $v_i\in\frak C$ and
$\bar\mu c\ge k\mu(a\Bcap b_i\Bcap c)$ whenever $c\in\frak C$ and
$c\Bsubseteq v_i$, while $\bar\mu c\le k\bar\mu(a\Bcap b_i\Bcap c)$
whenever $c\in\frak C$ and $c\Bcap v_i=0$.   Setting
$v=\inf_{i\le r}v_i$, we have

=\sum_{i=0}^rk\mu(a\Bcap b_i\Bcap v)\le(r+1)\bar\mu v$.}
     
\noindent Since $k\gamma>r+1$, $v=0$.   So if we now set
$w_i=(\inf_{j<i}v_j)\Bsetminus v_i$ for $i\le r$ (starting with
$w_0=1\Bsetminus v_0$), $(w_0,\ldots,w_r)$ is a partition of unity in
$\frak C$, and $\bar\mu c\le k\bar\mu(a\Bcap b_i\Bcap c)$ whenever
$c\in\frak C$ and $c\Bsubseteq w_i$.
     
By (a), we can find for each $i\le r$ an $e_i\in\frak A$ such that
$e_i\Bsubseteq a\Bcap b_i\Bcap w_i$ and
$\bar\mu(c\Bcap e_i)=\bover1k\bar\mu c$ whenever $c\in\frak C$ and

Let $\frak D$ be the subalgebra of the principal ideal

Of course $\bar\mu e=2^{-k}$ for every $e\in E$, so $\#(E)=2^{k-n}$ and
$\bar\mu(\sup E_1)\le 2^{-k}2^{2^n}\le 2^{-n}\epsilon$.   Write $e^*$
for $\sup E_1$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (b)} For $e\in E$ set $e'=\phi^{2^n-1}e$;  then
$\{e':e\in E\}$ is a disjoint

$\langle v_i\rangle_{i<2^{k-n}}$.   Note that

$\psi^jv_i\Bsubseteq d_{nl}$ whenever $i<2^{k-n}$ and
$j\equiv l$ mod $2^n$.   So
$\langle\psi^jv_0\rangle_{j<2^k}$ is a partition of unity in $\frak A$.

$j<2^m$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (d)} Let $\frak B$ be the subalgebra of $\frak A$ generated by
$\frak C\cup\{d'_{kj}:j<2^k\}$.
Recall the definition of $\{v_i:i<2^{k-n}\}$ as
$\{\phi^{2^n-1}e:e\in E\}$;  this implies that
     
\Centerline{$\{\psi v_i:i<2^{k-n}\}=\{\psi_1v_i:i<2^{k-n}\}
=\{\phi^{-2^n+1}v_i:i<2^{k-n}\}=E$,}

\Centerline{$\{\psi^{j+1}v_i:i<2^{k-n}\}=\{\phi^je:e\in E\}$}

Set $E_0=E\setminus E_1$.   For $e\in E_0$ and $i\le r$ there is a
$c_{ei}\in\frak C$ such that $e\Bcap b_i=e\Bcap c_{ei}$.   Set

  (i,j)\in K\}$.}
     
\noindent Then $a'$ is a supremum of (finitely many)
members of $\frak B$, so belongs to $\frak B$.   If $(i,j)\in K$ and
$e\in E_0$, then
     
\Centerline{$\phi^je\Bcap c_{ei}=\phi^j(e\Bcap c_{ei})

$d_{n1}\Bcap\phi^{-j}(a\Bsetminus a')\Bsubseteq e^*$ for each $j<2^n$.

\leader{388K}{Theorem} %3{8}7N
Let $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$ be a totally finite
measure algebra, with Maharam type $\omega$,
and $\pi:\frak A\to\frak A$ an aperiodic measure-preserving
automorphism.   Then there is a relatively
von Neumann automorphism $\phi:\frak A\to\frak A$ such that $\phi$ and
$\pi$ generate the same full subgroups of $\Aut\frak A$.
     
\proof{{\bf (a)} The idea is to construct $\phi$ as the limit of a
sequence $\sequencen{\phi_n}$ of weakly von Neumann automorphisms such
that $G_{\phi_n}=G_{\pi}$.   Each
$\phi_n$ will have a dyadic cycle system
$\langle d_{nmi}\rangle_{m\in\Bbb N,i<2^m}$;  there will be a strictly
increasing sequence $\sequencen{k_n}$ such that
     
\Centerline{$d_{n+1,m,i}=d_{n,m,i}$ whenever $m\le k_n$, $i<2^m$,}
     
\Centerline{$\phi_{n+1}a=\phi_na$ whenever $a\Bcap d_{n,k_n,0}=0$.}
     
\noindent Interpolated between the $\phi_n$ will be a second sequence
$\sequencen{\psi_n}$ in $G_{\pi}$,
with associated (finite) dyadic cycle systems
$\langle d'_{nmi}\rangle_{m\le k'_n,i<2^m}$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (b)} Before starting on the inductive construction we must fix on
a countable set $B\subseteq\frak A$ which $\tau$-generates $\frak A$,
and a sequence $\sequencen{b_n}$ in $B$ such that every member of $B$
recurs cofinally often in the sequence.   (For instance, take the
sequence of first members of an enumeration of $B\times\Bbb N$.)   As
usual, I write $\frak C$ for the closed subalgebra $\{c:\pi c=c\}$.
The induction begins with $\psi_0=\pi$, $k'_0=0$, $d'_{000}=1$.   Given
$\psi_n\in G_{\pi}$ and its dyadic cycle system
$\langle d'_{nmi}\rangle_{m\le k'_n,i<2^m}$, use 388H to find a weakly
von Neumann automorphism $\phi_n$, with dyadic cycle system
$\langle d_{nmi}\rangle_{m\in\Bbb N,i<2^m}$, such that
$G_{\phi_n}=G_{\pi}$, $d_{nmi}=d'_{nmi}$ for $m\le k'_n$ and $i<2^m$,
and $\phi_na=\psi_na$ whenever $a\Bcap d'_{n,k'_n,0}=0$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (c)} Given the weakly von Neumann automorphism
$\phi_n$, with its dyadic cycle system
$\langle d_{nmi}\rangle_{m\in\Bbb N,i<2^m}$, such that
$G_{\phi_n}=G_{\pi}$, then we have a partition of
unity $\langle e_{nj}\rangle_{j\in\Bbb Z}$ such that $\pi a=\phi_n^ja$
whenever $j\in\Bbb Z$ and $a\Bsubseteq e_{nj}$ (381I).   Take $r_n$
such that $\bar\mu\tilde e_n\le 2^{-n}$, where
$\tilde e_n=\sup_{|j|>r_n}e_{nj}$,
and $k_n>k'_n$ such that $2^{-k_n}(2r_n+1)\le 2^{-n}$.   Set
     
\Centerline{$e^*_n
=\sup_{|j|\le r_n}\phi_n^{-j}d_{n,k_n,0}$,}
     
\noindent so that $\bar\mu e^*_n\le 2^{-n+1}$.
     
Now use 388J to find a $\psi_{n+1}\in G_{\pi}$, with a dyadic cycle
system $\langle d'_{n+1,m,i}\rangle_{m\le k'_{n+1},i<2^m}$, such that
$k'_{n+1}\ge k_n$, $d'_{n+1,m,i}=d_{nmi}$ if $m\le k_n$,
$\psi_{n+1}a=\phi_na$ if
$a\Bcap d_{n,k_n,0}=0$, and there is a $b'_n$ in the algebra generated
by $\frak C\cup\{d'_{n+1,m,i}:m\le k'_{n+1},\,i<2^m\}$ such that
$\bar\mu(b_n\Bsymmdiff b'_n)\le 2^{-n}$.   Continue.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (d)} The effect of this construction is to ensure that if $l<n$ in
$\Bbb N$ then
     
\Centerline{$d_{lmi}=d_{nmi}$ whenever $m\le k_l$, $i<2^m$,}
     
\Centerline{$\phi_na=\phi_la$ whenever $a\Bcap d_{l,k_l,0}=0$,}
     
\Centerline{$b'_l$ belongs to the subalgebra generated by
$\frak C\cup\{d_{nmi}:m\le k_n,\,i<2^m\}$,}
     
\noindent and, of course, $d_{n,k_n,0}\Bsubseteq d_{l,k_l,0}$.   Since
$\sequencen{k_n}$ is strictly increasing, $\inf_{n\in\Bbb
N}d_{n,k_n,0}=0$.   Now, for each $n\in\Bbb N$,
     
\Centerline{$d_{n,k_n,1}
=\phi_nd_{n,k_n,0}
=\phi_{n+1}d_{n,k_n,0}\Bsupseteq
\phi_{n+1}d_{n+1,k_{n+1},0}
=d_{n+1,k_{n+1},1}$,}
     
\noindent so setting
     
\Centerline{$a_0=1\Bsetminus d_{0,k_0,0}$,
\quad$a_{n+1}=
d_{n,k_n,0}\Bsetminus d_{n+1,k_{n+1},0}$ for each $n$,}
     
\noindent we have
     
\Centerline{$\phi_0a_0=1\Bsetminus d_{0,k_0,1}$,
\quad$\phi_{n+1}a_{n+1}=d_{n,k_n,1}\Bsetminus d_{n+1,k_{n+1},1}$ for
each
$n$,}
     
\noindent and $\sequencen{\phi_na_n}$ is a partition of unity.
There is therefore
a $\phi\in\Aut\frak A$ defined by setting $\phi a=\phi_na$ if
$a\Bsubseteq a_n$;  because $G_{\pi}$ is full, $\phi\in G_{\pi}$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (e)} If $m\le n$, then $a_m\Bcap d_{m,k_m,0}=0$, so
$\phi_na=\phi_ma=\phi a$ for every $a\Bsubseteq a_m$.   Thus
$\phi_na=\phi a$ for
every $a\Bsubseteq\sup_{m\le n}a_m=1\Bsetminus d_{n,k_n,0}$.   In
particular, $\phi d_{nmi}=d_{n,m,i+1}$ whenever $m\le k_n$, $1\le i<2^m$
(counting $d_{n,m,2^m}$ as $d_{nm0}$, as usual);  so that in fact
$\phi d_{nmi}=d_{n,m,i+1}$ whenever $m\le k_n$, $i<2^m$.
     
For each $n$, we have $d_{nmi}=d'_{n+1,m,i}=d_{n+1,m,i}$ whenever
$m\le k_n$ and $i<2^m$.   We therefore have a family
$\langle d^*_{mi} \rangle_{m\in\Bbb N,i<2^m}$ defined by saying that
$d^*_{mi}=d_{nmi}$
whenever $n\in\Bbb N$, $m\le k_n$ and $i<2^m$.   Now, for any
$m\in \Bbb N$, there is a $k_n>m$, so that
$\langle d^*_{mi}\rangle_{i<2^m}
=\langle d_{nmi}\rangle_{i<2^m}$ is a partition of unity;  and
     
\Centerline{$d^*_{mi}=d_{nmi}=d_{n,m+1,i}\Bcup d_{n,m+1,i+2^m}
=d^*_{m+1,i}\Bcup d^*_{m+1,i+2^m}$}
     
\noindent for each $i<2^m$.   Moreover,
     
\Centerline{$\phi d^*_{m,i}=\phi_n d_{nmi}=d_{n,m,i+1}
=d^*_{m,i+1}$}
     
\noindent at least for $1\le i<2^m$ (counting $d^*_{m,2^m}$ as
$d^*_{m,0}$, as usual), so that in fact $\phi d^*_{mi}=d^*_{m,i+1}$
for every $i<2^m$.   Thus $\langle d^*_{mi}\rangle_{m\in\Bbb N,i<2^m}$
is a dyadic cycle system for $\phi$, and $\phi$ is a weakly von Neumann
automorphism.
     
Writing $\frak B$ for the closed subalgebra of $\frak A$ generated by
$\frak C\Bcup\{d^*_{mi}:m\in\Bbb N,\,i<2^m\}$, then
     
$$\eqalign{\frak C\cup \{d'_{nmi}:m\le k'_n,\,i<2^m\}
&=\frak C\cup\{d_{n+1,m,i}:m\le k'_n,\,i<2^m\}\cr
&=\frak C\cup\{d^*_{mi}:m\le k'_n,\,i<2^m\}
\subseteq\frak B\cr}$$
     
\noindent for any $n\in\Bbb N$.   So $b'_n\in\frak B$ for every $n$.
If $b\in B$ and $\epsilon>0$, there is an $n\in\Bbb N$ such that
$2^{-n}\le\epsilon$ and $b_n=b$, so that $\bar\mu(b\Bsymmdiff b'_n)
\le\epsilon$;  as every $b'_n$ belongs to $\frak B$, and $\frak B$
is closed, $b\in\frak B$;  as $b$ is arbitrary, and
$B\,\,\tau$-generates $\frak A$, $\frak B=\frak A$.   Thus $\phi$ is a
relatively von Neumann automorphism.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (f)} If $n\in\Bbb N$ and $d\Bcap e^*_n=0$, then $\phi^jd=\phi_n^jd$
and $\phi^{-j}d=\phi_n^{-j}d$ whenever $0\le j\le r_n$.   \Prf\ Induce
on
$j$.   For $j=0$ the result is trivial.   For the inductive step to
$j+1\le r_n$, note that if $d'\Bcap d_{n,k_n,1}=0$ then
$\phi_n^{-1}d'\Bcap d_{n,k_n,0}=0$, so
     
\Centerline{$\phi^{-1}d'=\phi^{-1}\phi_n(\phi_n^{-1}d')
=\phi^{-1}\phi(\phi_n^{-1}d')=\phi_n^{-1}d'$.}
     
\noindent Now we have
     
\Centerline{$\phi^{j+1}d=\phi(\phi_n^jd)
=\phi_n(\phi_n^jd)=\phi_n^{j+1}d$}
     
\noindent because
     
\Centerline{$\phi_n^jd\Bcap d_{n,k_n,0}
=\phi_n^j(d\Bcap\phi_n^{-j}d_{n,k_n,0})=0$,}
     
\noindent while
     
\Centerline{$\phi^{-j-1}d=\phi^{-1}(\phi_n^{-j}d)
=\phi_n^{-1}(\phi_n^{-j}d)=\phi_n^{-j-1}d$}
     
\noindent because
     
\Centerline{$\phi_n^{-j}d\Bcap d_{n,k_n,1}
=\phi_n^{-j}(d\Bcap\phi_n^{j+1}d_{n,k_n,0})=0$.  \Qed}
     
\noindent Thus $\phi^jd=\phi_n^jd$ whenever $|j|\le r_n$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (g)} Finally, $G_{\phi}=G_{\pi}$.   \Prf\ I remarked in (d) that
$\phi\in G_{\pi}$, so that $G_{\phi}\subseteq G_{\pi}$.   To see that
$\pi\in G_{\phi}$, take any non-zero $a\in\frak A$.   Because
$\bar\mu(e^*_n\Bcup\tilde e_n)\le 2^{-n+1}$ for each $n$, there is an
$n$ such that $a'=a\Bsetminus(e^*_n\Bcup\tilde e_n)\ne 0$.  Now there is
some $j\in\Bbb Z$ such that
$a''=a'\Bcap e_{nj}\ne 0$;  since $a'\Bcap\tilde e_n=0$, $|j|\le r_n$.
If $d\Bsubseteq a''$, then $\pi d=\phi_n^jd$, by the definition of
$e_{nj}$.   But also $\phi_n^jd=\phi^jd$, by (f), because
$d\Bcap e_n^*=0$.   So $\pi d=\phi^jd$ for every $d\Bsubseteq a''$.
As $a$ is arbitrary, $\pi\in G_{\phi}$ and
$G_{\pi}\subseteq G_{\phi}$.\ \Qed
     
This completes the proof.

\leader{388L}{Theorem} %3{8}7O
Let $(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1)$ and
$(\frak A_2, \bar\mu_2)$ be totally finite measure algebras of countable
Maharam type, and $\pi_1:\frak A_1 \to\frak A_1$,
$\pi_2:\frak A_2\to\frak A_2$ measure-preserving
automorphisms.   For each $i$, let $\frak C_i$ be the fixed-point
subalgebra of $\pi_i$ and $G_{\pi_i}$ the full subgroup of
$\Aut\frak A_i$ generated by $\pi_i$.   If
$(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1,\frak C_1)$ and $(\frak A_2,\bar\mu_2,\frak C_2)$
are isomorphic, so are $(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1,G_{\pi_1})$ and
$(\frak A_2,\bar\mu_2,G_{\pi_2})$.
     
\proof{{\bf (a)} It is enough to consider the case
in which $(\frak A_1,\bar\mu_1,\frak C_1)$ and $(\frak
A_2,\bar\mu_2,\frak C_2)$ are actually equal;  I therefore delete the
subscripts and speak of a structure $(\frak A,\bar\mu,\frak C)$, with
two automorphisms $\pi_1$, $\pi_2$ of $\frak A$ both with
fixed-point subalgebra $\frak C$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (b)} Suppose first that $\frak A$ is relatively atomless over
$\frak C$, that is, that both the $\pi_i$ are aperiodic (381P).   In
this case, 388K tells us that there are relatively von Neumann
automorphisms
$\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ of $\frak A$ such that $G_{\pi_1}=G_{\phi_1}$ and
$G_{\pi_2}=G_{\phi_2}$.   But
$(\frak A,\bar\mu,\phi_1)$ and $(\frak A,\bar\mu,\phi_2)$ are
isomorphic.   \Prf\ Let $\langle d_{mi}\rangle_{m\in\Bbb N,i<2^m}$ and
$\langle d'_{mi}\rangle_{m\in\Bbb N,i<2^m}$ be dyadic cycle systems for
$\phi_1$, $\phi_2$ respectively such that $\frak C\cup\{d_{mi}:m\in\Bbb
N,\,i<2^m\}$ and $\frak C\cup\{d'_{mi}:m\in\Bbb N,\,i<2^m\}$ both
$\tau$-generate $\frak A$.
     
Writing $\frak B_1$, $\frak B_2$ for the subalgebras of $\frak A$
generated by $\frak C\cup\{d_{mi}:m\in\Bbb N,\,i<2^m\}$ and $\frak
C\cup\{d'_{mi}:m\in\Bbb N,\,i<2^m\}$ respectively, it is easy to see
that these algebras are isomorphic:  we just set $\theta_0c=c$ for
$c\in\frak C$, $\theta_0d_{mi}=d'_{mi}$ for $i<2^m$ to obtain a
measure-preserving isomorphism $\theta_0:\frak B_1\to\frak B_2$.
Because these are topologically dense subalgebras of $\frak A$, there
is a unique extension of $\theta_0$ to a measure-preserving
automorphism $\theta:\frak A\to\frak A$ (324O).   Next, we see that
     
\Centerline{$\theta\phi_1\theta^{-1}c=c=\phi_2c$ for every
$c\in\frak C$,}
     
\Centerline{$\theta\phi_1\theta^{-1}d'_{mi}=\theta\phi_1d_{mi}
=\theta d_{m,i+1}=d'_{m,i+1}=\phi_2d'_{mi}$}
     
\noindent for $m\in\Bbb N$, $i<2^m$ (as usual, taking $d_{m,2^m}$ to be
$d_{m0}$ and $d'_{m,2^m}$ to be $d'_{m0}$).   But this means that
$\theta\phi_1\theta^{-1}b=\phi_2b$ for every $b\in\frak B_2$, so (again
because $\frak B_2$ is dense in $\frak A$)
$\theta\phi_1\theta^{-1}=\phi_2$.   Thus $\theta$ is an isomorphism
between $(\frak A,\bar\mu,\phi_1)$ and $(\frak A,\bar\mu,\phi_2)$.
\Qed\
     
Of course $\theta$ is now also an isomorphism between
$(\frak A,\bar\mu,G_{\phi_1})=(\frak A,\bar\mu,G_{\pi_1})$ and
$(\frak A,\bar\mu,G_{\phi_2})=(\frak A,\bar\mu,G_{\pi_2})$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (c)} Next, consider the case in which $\pi_1$ is periodic, with
period $n$, for some $n\ge 1$.   In this case $\pi_2\in G_{\pi_1}$.
\Prf\ Let $(d_0,\ldots,d_{n-1})$
be a partition of unity in $\frak A$ such that $\pi_1d_i=d_{i+1}$ for
$i<n-1$ and $\pi_1d_{n-1}=d_0$ (382Fb).   If $d\Bsubseteq d_j$, then
$c=\sup_{i<n}\pi_1^id\in\frak C$ and $d=d_j\Bcap c$;  so any member of
$\frak A$ is of the form $\sup_{j<n}d_j\Bcap c_j$ for some family
$c_0,\ldots,c_{n-1}$ in $\frak C$.
     
If $a\in\frak A\Bsetminus\{0\}$, take $i$,
$j<n$ such that $a'=a\Bcap d_i\Bcap\pi_2^{-1}d_j\ne 0$.   Then any
$d\Bsubseteq a'$ is of the form
     
\Centerline{$d_i\Bcap c_1=\pi_2^{-1}(d_j\Bcap c_2)
=c_2\Bcap\pi_2^{-1}d_j$}
     
\noindent for some $c_1$, $c_2\in\frak C$;  setting $c=c_1\Bcap c_2$, we
have
     
\Centerline{$d=d_i\Bcap c$,
\quad$\pi_2 d=d_j\Bcap c=\pi_1^{j-i}d$.}
     
\noindent As $a$ is arbitrary, this shows that
$\pi_2\in G_{\pi_1}$.\ \Qed
     
Now $\sup_{n\in\Bbb Z}\pi_2^nd_0$
belongs to $\frak C$ and includes $d_0$, so must be $1$.   Finally,
the two induced automorphisms $(\pi_1)_{d_0}$,
$(\pi_2)_{d_0}$ on $\frak A_{d_0}$ are both the identity.   \Prf\
If $0\ne\tilde d\Bsubseteq d_0$ there are a non-zero
$d'\Bsubseteq\tilde d$ and an $m\ge 1$ such that
$(\pi_2)_{d_0}d=\pi_2^md$ for every $d\Bsubseteq d'$.   As
$\pi_2^m\in G_{\pi_1}$, there are a
non-zero $d\Bsubseteq d'$ and a $k\in\Bbb Z$ such that
$\pi_2^md=\pi_1^kd$.   Now $\pi_1^kd\Bsubseteq d_0$ so $k$ is a multiple
of $n$ and $(\pi_2)_{d_0}d=\pi_1^kd=d$.   This shows that
$\{d:(\pi_2)_{d_0}d=d\}$ is order-dense in $\frak A_{d_0}$ and must be
the whole of $\frak A_{d_0}$.   As for $\pi_1$, we have
$(\pi_1)_{d_0}d=\pi_1^nd=d$ for every $d\Bsubseteq d_0$.\ \Qed
     
So 388G tells us that $G_{\pi_1}=G_{\pi_2}$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (d)} For the general case, we see from 381H that there is a
partition of unity $\langle c_i\rangle_{1\le i\le\omega}$ in $\frak C$
such that $\pi_1\restrp\frak A_{c_{\omega}}$ is aperiodic and if $i$ is
finite and $c_i\ne 0$ then $\pi_1\restrp\frak A_{c_i}$ is periodic with
period $i$.   For each $i$, let $H_i$ be
$\{\phi\restrp\frak A_{c_i}:\phi\in G_{\pi_1}\}$;  then $H_i$ is a full
subgroup of $\Aut\frak A_{c_i}$, and
     
\Centerline{$G_{\pi_1}=\{\phi:\phi\in\Aut\frak A$,
$\phi\restrp\frak A_{c_i}\in H_i$ whenever $1\le i\le\omega\}$.}
     
\noindent Similarly, writing
$H'_i=\{\phi\restrp\frak A_{c_i}:\phi\in G_{\pi_2}\}$,
     
\Centerline{$G_{\pi_2}=\{\phi:\phi\in\Aut\frak A$,
$\phi\restrp\frak A_{c_i}\in H'_i$ whenever $1\le i\le\omega\}$.}
     
\noindent Note also that $H_i$, $H'_i$ are the full subgroups of
$\Aut\frak A_{c_i}$ generated by $\pi_1\restrp\frak A_{c_i}$,
$\pi_2\restrp\frak A_{c_i}$ respectively.   By (b) and (c), $H_i=H'_i$
for finite $i$, while there is a measure-preserving automorphism
$\theta:\frak A_{c_{\omega}}\to\frak A_{c_{\omega}}$ such that
$\theta H_{\omega}\theta^{-1}=H'_{\omega}$.   Now we can define a
measure-preserving automorphism $\theta_1:\frak A\to\frak A$ by setting
$\theta_1a=\theta a$ if $a\Bsubseteq c_{\omega}$, $\theta_1a=a$ if
$a\Bcap c_{\omega}=0$, and we shall have
$\theta_1G_{\pi_1}\theta_1^{-1}=G_{\pi_2}$.   Thus
$(\frak A,\bar\mu,G_{\pi_1})$ and $(\frak A,\bar\mu,G_{\pi_2})$ are
isomorphic,
as claimed.

Let $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$ be a totally finite measure
algebra, and $\pi:\frak A\to\frak A$ a measure-preserving automorphism.
Let us say that a {\bf pseudo-cycle} for $\pi$ is a partition of unity
$\langle a_i\rangle_{i<n}$, where $n\ge 1$, such that $\pi a_i=a_{i+1}$
for $i<n-1$ (so that $\pi a_{n-1}=a_0$).   (i) Show that if we have
pseudo-cycles $\langle a_i\rangle_{i<n}$ and $\langle b_j\rangle_{j<m}$,
where $m$ is a multiple of $n$, then we have a pseudo-cycle $\langle
c_j\rangle_{j<m}$ with $c_0\Bsubseteq a_0$, so that
$a_i=\sup\{c_j:j<m,\,j\equiv i$ mod $n\}$ for every $i<n$.   (ii) Show
that $\pi$ is weakly von Neumann iff it has a pseudo-cycle of length
$2^n$ for any $n\in\Bbb N$.

\cmmnt{
\Notesheader{388} Dye's theorem ({\smc Dye 59}) is actually Theorem 388L
in the case in which $\pi_1$, $\pi_2$ are ergodic, that is, in which
$\frak C_1$ and $\frak C_2$ are both trivial.   I take the trouble to
give the generalized form here (a simplified version of that in {\smc
Krieger 76}) because it seems a natural target, once
we have a classification of the relevant structures
$(\frak A,\bar\mu,\frak C)$ (333R).   The essential mathematical ideas
are the same in both cases.   You can find the special case worked out
in {\smc Hajian Ito \& Kakutani 75}, from which I have taken the
argument used
here;  and you may find it useful to go through the version above, to
check what kind of simplifications arise if each $\frak C$ is taken to
be $\{0,1\}$.   Essentially the difference will be that every
`aperiodic' turns into `ergodic' (with an occasional `atomless'
thrown in) and `331B' turns into `331C'.   As far as I know,
there is no simplification available in the structure of the argument;
of course the details become a bit easier, but with the possible
exception of 388I-388J I think there is little difference.
     
Of course modifying a general argument to give a simpler proof of a
special case is a standard exercise in this kind of mathematics.   What
is much more interesting is the reverse process.   What kinds of theorem
about ergodic automorphisms will in fact be true of all automorphisms?
A variety of very powerful approaches to such questions have been
developed in the last half-century, and I hope to describe some of the
ideas in Volumes 4 and 5.   The methods used in this section are
relatively straightforward and do not require any deep theoretical
underpinning beyond Maharam's lemma 331B.   But an alternative
approach
can be found using 388Yd:  in effect (at least for the Lebesgue measure
algebra) any measure-preserving automorphism can be disintegrated into
ergodic measure space automorphisms (the fibre maps $f_x$ of 388Yd).
It is sometimes possible to guess which theorems about ergodic
transformations are `uniformisable' in the sense that they can be
applied to such a family $\langle f_x\rangle_{x\in[0,1]}$, in a
systematic way, to provide a structure which can be interpreted on the
product measure.   The details tend to be complex, which is one of the
reasons why I do not attempt to work through them here;  but such
disintegrations can be a most valuable aid to intuition.
     
In this section I use von Neumann automorphisms as an auxiliary tool:
the point is, first, that two von Neumann automorphisms are isomorphic
-- that is, the von Neumann automorphisms on a given totally finite
measure algebra $(\frak A,\bar\mu)$ (necessarily isomorphic to the
Lebesgue measure algebra, since we must have $\frak A$ atomless and
$\tau(\frak A)=\omega$) form a conjugacy class in the group
$\Aut_{\bar\mu}\frak A$ of measure-preserving automorphisms;  and next,
that for any ergodic measure-preserving automorphism $\pi$ (on an
atomless totally finite algebra of countable Maharam type) there is a
von Neumann automorphism $\phi$ such that $G_{\pi}=G_{\phi}$ (388K).
But I think they are remarkable in themselves.   A
(weakly) von Neumann automorphism has a `pseudo-cycle' (388Xa) for
every power of 2.   For some purposes, existence is all we need to know;
but in the arguments of 388H-388K we need to keep track of named
pseudo-cycles in what I call `dyadic cycle systems' (388D).
     
In this volume I have systematically preferred arguments which deal
directly with measure algebras, rather than with measure spaces.   I
believe that such arguments can have a simplicity and clarity which
repays the extra effort of dealing with more abstract structures.   But
undoubtedly it is necessary, if you are to have any hope of going
farther in the subject, to develop methods of transferring intuitions
and theorems between the two contexts.   I offer 381Xl as an example.
The description there of `induced automorphism' requires a certain
amount of manoeuvering around negligible sets, but gives a
valuably graphic description.   In the same way, 381Xf, 388A and 381Qc
provide alternative ways of looking at full subgroups.
     
There are contexts in which it is useful to know whether an element of
the full subgroup generated by $\pi$ actually belongs to the full
semigroup generated by $\pi$ (381Yb);  for instance, this happens in
388C.
