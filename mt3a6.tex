For Chapter 38 we need four definitions and two results from elementary 
abstract group theory. 
      
\leader{3A6A}{Definition} If $G$ is a group, \cmmnt{I will say that} an 
element $g$ of $G$ is an {\bf involution} if its order is 
2\cmmnt{, that is, $g^2=e$, the identity of $G$, but $g\ne e$}. 
      
      
\leader{3A6B}{Definition} If $G$ is a group, the set $\Aut G$ of 
{\bf automorphisms} of $G$ (that is, bijective homomorphisms from $G$ to 
itself) is a group.   For $g\in G$ define $\hat g:G\to G$ by writing 
$\hat g(h)=ghg^{-1}$ for every $h\in G$;  then $\hat g\in\Aut G$, and 
the map $g\mapsto\hat g$ is a homomorphism from $G$ onto a normal subgroup $J$ of $\Aut G$\cmmnt{ ({\smc Rotman 84}, p.\ 130)}. 
We call $J$ the group of {\bf inner automorphisms} 
of $G$.   Members of $(\Aut G)\setminus J$ are called {\bf outer automorphisms}. 
      
\leader{3A6C}{Normal subgroups} For any group $G$, the family of 
normal subgroups of $G$, ordered by $\subseteq$, 
is a Dedekind complete lattice, with $H\vee K=HK$ and 
$H\wedge K=H\cap K$.   \cmmnt{({\smc Davey \& Priestley 90},
