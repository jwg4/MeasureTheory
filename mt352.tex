In this section I sketch those fragments of the theory we need which can
be expressed as theorems about general Riesz spaces or vector lattices.
I begin with the definition (352A) and most elementary properties
(352C-352F).
In 352G-352J I discuss Riesz homomorphisms and the associated subspaces
(Riesz subspaces, solid linear subspaces);  I mention product spaces
(352K, 352T) and quotient spaces (352Jb, 352U) and the form the
representation theorem 351Q takes in the present context
(352L-352M).   Most of the second half of the section
concerns the theory of `bands' in Riesz spaces, with the algebras of
complemented bands (352Q) and projection bands (352S) and a description
of bands generated by upwards-directed sets (352V).   I conclude with a
description of `$f$-algebras' (352W).
     
\leader{352A}{}\cmmnt{ I repeat a definition from 241E.
     
\medskip
     
\noindent}{\bf Definition} A {\bf Riesz space} or {\bf vector lattice}
is a partially ordered linear space which is a lattice.
     
\leader{352B}{Lemma} If $U$ is a \pols, then it is a Riesz space iff
$\sup\{0,u\}$ is defined for every $u\in U$.
     
\proof{ If $U$ is a lattice, then of course $\sup\{u,0\}$ is defined for
every $u$.   If $\sup\{u,0\}$ is defined for every $u$, and $v_1$, $v_2$
are any two members of $U$, consider $w=v_1+\sup\{0,v_2-v_1\}$;  by
351Db, $w=\sup\{v_1,v_2\}$.   Next,
     
\Centerline{$\inf\{v_1,v_2\}=-\sup\{-v_1,-v_2\}$}
     
\noindent must also be defined in $U$;  as $v_1$ and $v_2$ are
arbitrary, $U$ is a lattice.
}%end of proof of 352B
     
\leader{352C}{Notation} In any Riesz space $U$ I will write
     
\Centerline{$u^+=u\vee 0$,\quad $u^-=(-u)\vee 0=(-u)^+$,\quad
$|u|=u\vee(-u)$}
     
\noindent where (as in any lattice) $u\vee v=\sup\{u,v\}$ (and $u\wedge
v=\inf\{u,v\}$).
     
\dvro{A}{I mention immediately a term which will be useful:  a} family
$\familyiI{u_i}$ in $U$ is {\bf disjoint} if
$|u_i|\wedge|u_j|=0$ for all distinct $i$, $j\in I$.   Similarly, a set
$C\subseteq U$ is {\bf disjoint} if $|u|\wedge|v|=0$ for all distinct
$u$, $v\in C$.
     
\leader{352D}{Elementary identities} Let $U$ be a Riesz space.
\cmmnt{ The translation-invariance of the order, and its invariance
under positive scalar multiplication, reversal under negative
multiplication, lead directly to the following, which are in effect
special cases of 351D:}
     
\Centerline{$u+(v\vee w)=(u+v)\vee(u+w)$,

\leader{352F}{Further identities
and \dvrocolon{inequalities}}\cmmnt{ At a
slightly deeper level we have the following facts.
     
\medskip
     
\noindent}{\bf Proposition} Let $U$ be a Riesz space.
     
(a) If $u$, $v$, $w\ge 0$ in $U$ then 
$u\wedge(v+w)\le (u\wedge v)+(u\wedge w)$.
     
(b) If $u_0,\ldots,u_n\in U$ are disjoint, then
$|\sum_{i=0}^n\alpha_i u_i|=\sum_{i=0}^n|\alpha_i||u_i|$ for any
$\alpha_0,\ldots,\alpha_n\in\Bbb R$.
     
(c) If $u$, $v\in U$ then
     
\Centerline{$u^+\wedge v^+\le(u+v)^+\le u^++v^+$.}
     
(d) If $u_0,\ldots,u_m,v_0,\ldots,v_n\in U^+$ and
$\sum_{i=0}^mu_i=\sum_{j=0}^nv_j$, then there is a family $\langle
w_{ij}\rangle_{i\le m,j\le n}$ in $U^+$ such that
$\sum_{i=0}^mw_{ij}=v_j$ for every $j\le n$ and $\sum_{j=0}^nw_{ij}=u_i$
for every $i\le m$.
     
\proof{{\bf (a)}
     
$$\eqalign{u\wedge(v+w)
&\le[(u+w)\wedge(v+w)]\wedge u\cr
&\le[(u\wedge v)+w]\wedge[(u\wedge v)+u]
=(u\wedge v)+(u\wedge w).\cr}$$
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (b)(i)}\grheada\ A simple induction, using (a) for the inductive
step,  shows that if $v_0,\ldots,v_m$, $w_0,\ldots,w_n$ are non-negative
then
$\sum_{i=0}^mv_i\wedge\sum_{j=0}^nw_j
\le\sum_{i=0}^m\sum_{j=0}^nv_i\wedge w_j$.
\grheadb\ Next, if $u\wedge v=0$ then
     
\Centerline{$(u-v)^+=u-(u\wedge v)=u$,\quad$(u-v)^-=(v-u)^+=v-(v\wedge
u)=v$,}
     
\Centerline{$|u-v|=(u-v)^++(u-v)^-=u+v=|u+v|$,}
     
\noindent so if $|u|\wedge|v|=0$ then
     
$$\eqalign{(u^++v^+)\wedge(u^-+v^-)
&\le (u^+\wedge u^-)+(u^+\wedge v^-)+(v^+\wedge u^-)+(v^+\wedge v^-)\cr
&\le 0+(|u|\wedge|v|)+(|v|\wedge|u|)+0=0\cr}$$
     
\noindent and
     
\Centerline{$|u+v|=|(u^++v^+)-(u^-+v^-)|=u^++v^++u^-+v^-=|u|+|v|$.}
     
\noindent \grheadc\ Finally, if $|u|\wedge|v|=0$ and $\alpha$,
$\beta\in\Bbb R$,
     
\Centerline{$|\alpha u|\wedge|\beta v|
=|\alpha||u|\wedge|\beta||v|
\le(|\alpha|+|\beta|)|u|\wedge(|\alpha|+|\beta|)|v|
=(|\alpha|+|\beta|)(|u|\wedge|v|)
=0$.}
     
\medskip
     
\quad{\bf (ii)} We may therefore proceed by induction.   The case $n=0$
is trivial.   For the inductive step to $n+1$, setting
$u'_i=\alpha_iu_i$ we have $|u'_i|\wedge|u'_j|=0$ for all $i\ne j$, by
(i-$\gamma$).   By (i-$\alpha$),
     
\Centerline{$|u'_{n+1}|\wedge|\sum_{i=0}^nu'_i|
\le|u'_{n+1}|\wedge\sum_{i=0}^n|u'_i|
\le\sum_{i=0}^n|u'_{n+1}|\wedge|u'_i|=0$,}
     
\noindent so by (i-$\beta$) and the inductive hypothesis
     
\Centerline{$|\sum_{i=0}^{n+1}u'_i|
=|u'_{n+1}|+|\sum_{i=0}^nu'_i|
=\sum_{i=0}^{n+1}|u'_i|$}
     
\noindent as required.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (c)} By 352E,
     
\Centerline{$u^+\wedge v^+=(u\vee 0)\wedge(v\vee 0)=(u\wedge v)\vee 0$.}
     
\noindent Now
     
\Centerline{$u\wedge v=\Bover12(u+v-|u-v|)\le\Bover12(u+v+|u+v|)
=(u+v)^+$,}
     
\noindent and of course $0\le(u+v)^+$, so $u^+\wedge v^+\le(u+v)^+$.
     
For the other inequality we need only note that $u+v\le u^++v^+$
(because $u\le u^+$, $v\le v^+$) and $0\le u^++v^+$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (d)} Write $w$ for the common value of $\sum_{i=0}^mu_i$ and
$\sum_{j=0}^nv_j$.
     
Induce on
$k=\#(\{(i,j):i\le m,\,j\le n,\,u_i\wedge v_j>0\})$.   If $k=0$, that
is, $u_i\wedge v_j=0$ for all $i$, $j$, then (by (a), used repeatedly)
we must have $w\wedge
w=0$, that is, $w=0$, and we can take $w_{ij}=0$ for all $i$, $j$.   For
the inductive step to $k\ge 1$, take $i^*$, $j^*$ such that
$w^*=u_{i^*}\wedge v_{j^*}>0$.   Set
     
\Centerline{$\tilde u_{i^*}=u_{i^*}-w^*$,\quad $\tilde u_i=u_i$ for
$i\ne i^*$,}
     
\Centerline{$\tilde v_{j^*}=v_{j^*}-w^*$,\quad $\tilde v_j=v_j$ for
$j\ne j^*$.}
     
\noindent Then
$\sum_{i=0}^m\tilde u_i=\sum_{j=0}^n\tilde v_j=w-w^*$ and
$\tilde u_i\wedge\tilde v_j\le u_i\wedge v_j$ for all $i$, $j$,
while $\tilde u_{i^*}\wedge\tilde v_{j^*}=0$;  so that
     
\Centerline{$\#(\{(i,j):\tilde u_i\wedge\tilde v_j>0\})<k$.}
     
\noindent By the inductive hypothesis, there are $\tilde w_{ij}\ge 0$,
for $i\le m$ and $j\le n$, such that
$\tilde u_i=\sum_{j=0}^n\tilde w_{ij}$ for each $i$ and
$\tilde v_j=\sum_{i=0}^m\tilde w_{ij}$ for each
$j$.   Set $w_{i^*j^*}=\tilde w_{i^*j^*}+w^*$,
$w_{ij}=\tilde w_{ij}$ for
$(i,j)\ne(i^*,j^*)$;  then $u_i=\sum_{j=0}^nw_{ij}$ and
$v_j=\sum_{i=0}^mw_{ij}$, so the induction proceeds.

\leader{352G}{Riesz homomorphisms:  Proposition} Let $U$ be a Riesz

(i) $T$ is a Riesz homomorphism in the sense of 351H;
     
(ii) $(Tu)^+=\sup\{Tu,0\}$ is defined and equal to $T(u^+)$ for every

(iii) $\sup\{Tu,-Tu\}$ is defined and equal to $T|u|$ for every

Riesz homomorphism.
     
Finally, for (iv)$\Rightarrow$(ii), we know from (iv) that
$0=\inf\{T(u^+),T(u^-)\}$, so $-T(u^+)=\inf\{0,-Tu\}$ and
$T(u^+)=\sup\{0,Tu\}$.

so $T^{-1}(v^+)=u^+=(T^{-1}v)^+$.   Thus $T^{-1}$ is a Riesz

\leader{352M}{Corollary} Any identity involving the operations $+$, $-$,
$\vee$, $\wedge$, $^+$, $^-$, $|\,\,|$ and scalar multiplication, and
the relation $\le$, which is valid in $\Bbb R$, is valid in all Riesz

\noindent{\bf Remark} I suppose some would say that a strict proof of
this must begin with a formal description of what the phrase \lq any
identity involving the operations$\ldots$' means.   However I think it
is clear in practice what is involved.   Given a proposed identity like

\le\sum_{i\ne j}(|\alpha_i|+|\alpha_j|)(|u_i|\wedge|u_j|)$,}
     
\noindent (compare 352Fb), then to check that it is valid in all Riesz
spaces you need only check (i) that it is true in $\Bbb R$ (ii) that it
is true in $\Bbb R^X$ (iii) that it is true in any $\Bbb R^X|\Cal F$
(iv) that it is true in any Riesz subspace of $\Bbb R^X|\Cal F$;  and
you can hope that
the arguments for (ii)-(iv) will be nearly trivial, since
(ii) is generally nothing but a coordinate-by-coordinate repetition of
(i), and (iii) and (iv) involve only transformations of the formula by
Riesz homomorphisms which preserve its structure.

{\bf (a)} Of course $\frak C$ is partially ordered by $\subseteq$.   If

$V\vee W=\sup\{V,W\}$ will be $(V^{\perp}\cap W^{\perp})^{\perp}$;  thus
$\frak C$ is a lattice.   Note also that $V\vee W$ must be the smallest
complemented band including $V+W$, that is, it is $(V+W)^{\perp\perp}$.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (b)} If $V_1$, $V_2$, $W\in\frak C$ then $(V_1\vee V_2)\wedge
W=(V_1\wedge W)\vee(V_2\wedge W)$.   \Prf\ Of course
$(V_1\vee V_2)\wedge W\supseteq(V_1\wedge W)\vee(V_2\wedge W)$.   \Quer\
Suppose, if possible, that there is a $u\in(V_1\vee V_2)\cap
W\setminus((V_1\cap W)\vee(V_2\cap W))$.   Then $u\notin((V_1\cap
W)^{\perp}\cap(V_2\cap W)^{\perp})^{\perp}$, so there is a $v\in(V_1\cap
W)^{\perp}\cap(V_2\cap W)^{\perp}$ such that $u_1=|u|\wedge|v|>0$.   Now
$u_1\in V_1\vee V_2=(V_1^{\perp}\cap V_2^{\perp})^{\perp}$ so $u_1\notin
V_1^{\perp}\cap V_2^{\perp}$;  say $u_1\notin V_j^{\perp}$, and there is
a $v_j\in V_j$ such that $u_2=u_1\wedge|v_j|>0$.   In this case we still
have $u_2\in (V_j\cap W)^{\perp}$, because $u_2\le|v|$, but also $u_2\in
V_j$ and $u_2\in W$ because $u_2\le|u|$;  but this means that
$u_2=u_2\wedge u_2=0$, which is absurd.\ \Bang\  Thus
$(V_1\vee V_2)\wedge W\subseteq(V_1\wedge W)\vee(V_2\wedge W)$ and the

$v\in V\cap V^{\perp}$ then $|v|=|v|\wedge|v|=0$.   By 311L, $\frak C$
has a Boolean algebra structure, with the Boolean relations described;
by 312M, this structure is uniquely defined.

{\bf (d)} Finally, if $\Cal V\subseteq\frak C$ is non-empty, then

(c) If $V\in\frak B$ then the algebra of projection bands in $V$ is just
the principal ideal of $\frak B$ generated by $V$.
     
\proof{{\bf (a)} Of course $0_{\frak C}=\{0\}\in\frak B$.   If

$|w|+|w'|=|w+w'|=|v|\in V$, $w'$ belongs to $V$, and is in

$W+W^{\perp}_V=V$ and $W$ is a projection band in $V$.   Conversely, if

(a) If $A\subseteq U^+$ is upwards-directed and $2w\in A$ for every
$w\in A$, then an element $u$ of $U$ belongs to the band generated by
$A$ iff $|u|=\sup_{w\in A}|u|\wedge w$.
     
(b) If $u\in U$ and $w\in U^+$, then $u$ belongs to the band in $U$
generated by $w$ iff $|u|=\sup_{n\in\Bbb N}|u|\wedge nw$.
     
\proof{{\bf (a)} Let $W$ be the band generated by $A$ and $W'$ the set
of elements of $U$ satisfying the condition.
     
\medskip
     
\quad{\bf (i)} If $u\in W'$ then $|u|\wedge w\in W$ for every $w\in A$,
because $W$ is a solid linear subspace;  because $W$ is also
order-closed, $|u|$ and $u$ belong to $W$.   Thus $W'\subseteq W$.
     
\medskip
     
\quad{\bf (ii)} Now $W'$ is a band.
     
\medskip
     
\Prf\grheada\ If $u\in W'$ and $|v|\le|u|$ then
     
\Centerline{$\sup_{w\in A}|v|\wedge w
=\sup_{w\in A}|v|\wedge|u|\wedge w
=|v|\wedge\sup_{w\in A}|u|\wedge w
=|v|\wedge|u|=|v|$}
     
\noindent by 352Ea, so $v\in W'$.
     
\medskip
     
\qquad\grheadb\ If $u$, $v\in W'$ then, for any $w_1$, $w_2\in A$ there
is a $w\in A$ such that $w\ge w_1\vee w_2$.   Now $w_1+w_2\le 2w\in
A$, and
     
\Centerline{$(|u|+|v|)\wedge 2w
\ge(|u|\wedge w_1)+(|v|\wedge w_2)$.}
     
\noindent So any upper bound for $\{(|u|+|v|)\wedge w:w\in A\}$ must
also be an upper bound for
$\{|u|\wedge w:w\in A\}+\{|v|\wedge w:w\in A\}$ and therefore greater
than or equal to
     
$$\eqalign{\sup(\{|u|\wedge w:w\in A\}+\{|v|\wedge w:w\in A\})
&=\sup_{w\in A}|u|\wedge w+\sup_{w\in A}|v|\wedge w\cr
&=|u|+|v|\cr}$$
     
\noindent (351Dc).   But this means that
$\sup_{w\in A}(|u|+|v|)\wedge w$ must be $|u|+|v|$, and $|u|+|v|$
belongs to $W'$;  it follows from ($\alpha$) that $u+v$ belongs to $W'$.
     
\medskip
     
\qquad\grheadc\ Just as in 352Oc, we now have
     
\Centerline{$nu\in W'$ for every $n\in\Bbb N$, $u\in W'$,}
     
\noindent and therefore $\alpha u\in W'$ for every $\alpha\in\Bbb R$,
$u\in W'$, since $|\alpha u|\le|nu|$ if $|\alpha|\le n$.   Thus $W'$ is
a solid linear subspace of $U$.
     
\medskip
     
\qquad\grheadd\  Now suppose that $C\subseteq (W')^+$ has a supremum $v$
in $U$.   Then any upper bound of $\{v\wedge w:w\in A\}$ must also be an
upper bound of $\{u\wedge w:u\in C,\,w\in A\}$ and greater than or equal
to $u=\sup_{w\in A}u\wedge w$ for every $u\in C$, therefore greater than
or equal to $v=\sup C$.   Thus $v=\sup_{w\in A}v\wedge w$ and $v\in W'$.
As $C$ is arbitrary, $W'$ is a band (352Ob).\ \Qed
     
\medskip
     
\quad{\bf (iii)} Since $A$ is obviously included in $W'$, $W'$ must
include $W$;  putting this together with (i), $W=W'$, as claimed.
     
\medskip
     
{\bf (b)} Apply (a) with $A=\{nw:n\in\Bbb N\}$.

\cmmnt{
\Notesheader{352} In this section we begin to see a striking
characteristic of the theory of Riesz spaces:  repeated reflections of
results in Boolean algebra.   Without spelling out a complete list, I
mention the distributive laws (313Bc, 352Ea) and the behaviour of
order-continuous homomorphisms (313Pa, 313Qa, 352N, 352Oe, 352Ub,
352Xe).
Riesz subspaces correspond to subalgebras, solid linear subspaces to
ideals and Riesz homomorphisms to Boolean homomorphisms.
We even have a correspondence, though a weaker one, between the
representation theorems available;  every Boolean algebra is isomorphic
to a subalgebra of a power of $\Bbb Z_2$ (311D-311E), while every
Riesz space is isomorphic to a Riesz subspace of a quotient of a power
of $\Bbb R$ (352L).   It would be a closer parallel if every Riesz space
were embeddable in some $\Bbb R^X$;  I must emphasize that the
differences are as important as the agreements.   Subspaces of
$\BbbR^X$ are of great importance, but are by no means adequate for our
needs.   And of course the details -- for instance, the identities in
352D-352F, or 352V -- frequently involve new techniques in the case of
Riesz spaces.   Elsewhere, as in 352G, I find myself arguing rather from
the opposite side, when applying results from the theory of general
partially ordered linear spaces, which has little to do with Boolean
algebra.
     
In the theory of bands in Riesz spaces -- corresponding to order-closed
ideals in Boolean algebras -- we have a new complication in the form of
bands which are not complemented, which does not arise in the Boolean
algebra context;  but it disappears again when we come to specialize to
Archimedean Riesz spaces (353B).   (Similarly, order-density and
quasi-order-density coincide in both Boolean algebras (313K) and
Archimedean Riesz spaces (353A).)   Otherwise the algebra of
complemented bands in a Riesz space looks very like the algebra of
order-closed ideals in a Boolean algebra (314Yh, 352Q).   The algebra
of projection bands in a Riesz space (352S) would correspond, in a
Boolean algebra, to the algebra itself.
     
I draw your attention to 352H.   The result is nearly trivial, but it
amounts to saying that the theory of Riesz spaces will be `algebraic',
like the theories of groups or linear spaces, rather than `analytic',
like the theories of \pols s or topological spaces, in which we can have
bijective morphisms which are not isomorphisms.
