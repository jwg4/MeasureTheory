As is to be expected, we are coming in this volume to depend on a wide 
variety of more or less recondite information, and only an exceptionally 
broad mathematical education will have covered it all.   While all the 
principal ideas are fully expressed in standard textbooks, there are 
many minor points where I need to develop variations on the familiar 
formulations.   A little under half the material, by word-count, is in   
general topology (\S4A2), where I begin with some pages of definitions.   
I follow this with a section on Borel and Baire  
$\sigma$-algebras, Baire-property algebras and cylindrical algebras (\S4A3),  
worked out a little more thoroughly than the rest of the material.  
The other sections are on set theory (\S4A1), linear analysis (\S4A4), 
topological groups (\S4A5) and Banach algebras (\S4A6).
